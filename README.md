# ERU-KG: An unsupervised keyphrase generation AND extraction model

Implementation of [ERU-KG: Efficient Reference-aligned Unsupervised Keyphrase Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24219)

## We are finetuning this repository!! Will be done with all instructions soon (hopefully before 5th of June 2025)

## Quick start ðŸš€

Please refer to this [introduction notebook](introduction.ipynb)


## Data Processing
We documented the procedure for creating training dataset for ERU-KG in this [folder](data_processing)


## Training with custom dataset
To be updated


## Evaluation
Please refer to this [documentation](evaluation/README.md)
