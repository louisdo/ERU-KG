The standardization of grids based on web services has resulted in the need for scalable web service discovery mechanisms to be deployed in grids Even though UDDI has been the de facto industry standard for web-services discovery, imposed requirements of tight-replication among registries and lack of autonomous control has severely hindered its widespread deployment and usage. With the advent of grid computing the scalability issue of UDDI will become a roadblock that will prevent its deployment in grids. In this paper we present our distributed web-service discovery architecture, called DUDE (Distributed UDDI Deployment Engine). DUDE leverages DHT (Distributed Hash Tables) as a rendezvous mechanism between multiple UDDI registries. DUDE enables consumers to query multiple registries, still at the same time allowing organizations to have autonomous control over their registries..
