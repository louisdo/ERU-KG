Besides the dilaton tadpole, a dynamical\\ninstability in the complex structure moduli space occurs at string disc level,\\nwhich drives the background geometry to a degenerate limit. We show that in\\ncertain orbifold models this latter instability is absent as the relevant\\nmoduli are frozen. We construct explicit examples of such orbifold intersecting\\nbrane world models and discuss the phenomenological implications of a three\\ngeneration Standard Model which descends naturally from an SU(5) GUT theory. It\\nturns out that various phenomenological issues require the string scale to be\\nat least of the order of the GUT scale. As a major difference compared to the\\nStandard Model, some of the Yukawa couplings are excluded so that the standard\\nelectroweak Higgs mechanism with a fundamental Higgs scalar is not realized in\\nthis set-up.',\n",

When lifted to M theory, the model\\namounts to compactification of M-theory on a G_2 manifold.

       "  'Perceiver: General Perception with Iterative Attention. Biological systems perceive the world by simultaneously processing\\nhigh-dimensional inputs from modalities as diverse as vision, audition, touch,\\nproprioception, etc. The perception models used in deep learning on the other\\nhand are designed for individual modalities, often relying on domain-specific\\nassumptions such as the local grid structures exploited by virtually all\\nexisting vision models. These priors introduce helpful inductive biases, but\\nalso lock models to individual modalities. In this paper we introduce the\\nPerceiver - a model that builds upon Transformers and hence makes few\\narchitectural assumptions about the relationship between its inputs, but that\\nalso scales to hundreds of thousands of inputs, like ConvNets. The model\\nleverages an asymmetric attention mechanism to iteratively distill inputs into\\na tight latent bottleneck, allowing it to scale to handle very large inputs. We\\nshow that this architecture is competitive with or outperforms strong,\\nspecialized models on classification tasks across various modalities: images,\\npoint clouds, audio, video, and video+audio. The Perceiver obtains performance\\ncomparable to ResNet-50 and ViT on ImageNet without 2D convolutions by directly\\nattending to 50,000 pixels.

       "  'Three-Dimensional Boltzmann-Hydro Code for core-collapse in massive stars III. A New method for momentum feedback from neutrino to matter. We present a new method for neutrino-matter coupling in multi-dimensional\\nradiation-hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernova (CCSN) with the\\nfull Boltzmann neutrino transport. The development is motivated by the fact\\nthat the accurate conservation of momentum is required for reliable numerical\\nmodelings of CCSN dynamics including a recoil of proto-neutron star (PNS). The\\nnew method is built on a hybrid approach, in which we use the energy-momentum\\ntensor of neutrinos to compute the momentum feedback from neutrino to matter in\\nthe optically thick region while we employ the collision term in the optically\\nthin region. In this method we utilize a general relativistic description of\\nradiation-hydrodynamics with angular moments, which allows us to evaluate the\\nmomentum feedback from neutrino to matter without inconsistency with our\\nBoltzmann solver. We demonstrate that the new method substantially improves the\\naccuracy of linear momentum conservation in our CCSN simulations under\\nreasonable angular resolutions in momentum space, alleviating the difficulty in\\ngiving the diffusion limit precisely with the discrete ordinate (Sn) method. It\\nis the first-ever demonstration that the PNS kick can be handled directly and\\nproperly in multi-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations with the full\\nBoltzmann neutrino transport.'],\n",

       "  'Radiation Magnetohydrodynamics In Global Simulations Of Protoplanetary Disks. Our aim is to study the thermal and dynamical evolution of protoplanetary\\ndisks in global simulations, including the physics of radiation transfer and\\nmagneto-hydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence caused by the magneto-rotational\\ninstability. We develop a radiative transfer method based on the flux-limited\\ndiffusion approximation that includes frequency dependent irradiation by the\\ncentral star. This hybrid scheme is implemented in the PLUTO code. The focus of\\nour implementation is on the performance of the radiative transfer method.\\nUsing an optimized Jacobi preconditioned BiCGSTAB solver, the radiative module\\nis three times faster than the MHD step for the disk setup we consider. We\\nobtain weak scaling efficiencies of 70% up to 1024 cores. We present the first\\nglobal 3D radiation MHD simulations of a stratified protoplanetary disk. The\\ndisk model parameters are chosen to approximate those of the system AS 209 in\\nthe star-forming region Ophiuchus. Starting the simulation from a disk in\\nradiative and hydrostatic equilibrium, the magnetorotational instability\\nquickly causes MHD turbulence and heating in the disk. For the disk parameters\\nwe use, turbulent dissipation heats the disk midplane and raises the\\ntemperature by about 15% compared to passive disk models. A roughly flat\\nvertical temperature profile establishes in the disk optically thick region\\nclose to the midplane. We reproduce the vertical temperature profile with a\\nviscous disk models for which the stress tensor vertical profile is flat in the\\nbulk of the disk and vanishes in the disk corona. The present paper\\ndemonstrates for the first time that global radiation MHD simulations of\\nturbulent protoplanetary disks are feasible with current computational\\nfacilities. This opens up the windows to a wide range of studies of the\\ndynamics of protoplanetary disks inner parts, for which there are significant\\nobservational constraints.'],\n",

The modelling of the adherence energy during peeling of Pressure Sensitive\\nAdhesives (PSA) has received much attention since the 1950's, uncovering\\nseveral factors that aim at explaining their high adherence on most substrates,\\nsuch as the softness and strong viscoelastic behaviour of the adhesive, the low\\nthickness of the adhesive layer and its confinement by a rigid backing. The\\nmore recent investigation of adhesives by probe-tack methods also revealed the\\nimportance of cavitation and stringing mechanisms during debonding, underlining\\nthe influence of large deformations and of the related non-linear response of\\nthe material, which also intervenes during peeling. Although a global modelling\\nof the complex coupling of all these ingredients remains a formidable issue, we\\nreport here some key experiments and modelling arguments that should constitute\\nan important step forward.

Three U(1)'s become massive through\\ntheir couplings to RR fields and from the three surviving massless U(1)'s at\\nlow energies, one is the standard model hypercharge generator. The two extra\\nmassless U(1)'s get broken, as suggested recently (hep-th/0205147), by\\nrequiring some intersections to respect N=1 supersymmetry thus supporting the\\nappearance of massless charged singlets. Proton and lepton number are gauged\\nsymmetries and their anomalies are cancelled through a generalized\\nGreen-Schwarz mechanism that gives masses to the corresponding gauge bosons\\nthrough couplings to RR fields. Thus proton is stable and neutrinos are of\\nDirac type with small masses as a result of a PQ like-symmetry. The models\\npredict the existence of only two supersymmetric particles, superpartners of\\n$\\\\nu_R$'s.\"],\n",

       "  \"A data-analysis strategy for detecting gravitational-wave signals from inspiraling compact binaries with a network of laser-interferometric detectors. A data-analysis strategy based on the maximum-likelihood method (MLM) is\\npresented for the detection of gravitational waves from inspiraling compact\\nbinaries with a network of laser-interferometric detectors having arbitrary\\norientations and arbitrary locations around the globe. The MLM is based on the\\nnetwork likelihood ratio (LR), which is a function of eight signal-parameters\\nthat determine the Newtonian inspiral waveform. In the MLM-based strategy, the\\nLR must be maximized over all of these parameters. Here, we show that it is\\npossible to maximize it analytically over four of the eight parameters.\\nMaximization over a fifth parameter, the time of arrival, is handled most\\nefficiently by using the Fast-Fourier-Transform algorithm. This allows us to\\nscan the parameter space continuously over these five parameters and also cuts\\ndown substantially on the computational costs. Maximization of the LR over the\\nremaining three parameters is handled numerically. This includes the\\nconstruction of a bank of templates on this reduced parameter space.

       "  \"A data-analysis strategy for detecting gravitational-wave signals from inspiraling compact binaries with a network of laser-interferometric detectors. A data-analysis strategy based on the maximum-likelihood method (MLM) is\\npresented for the detection of gravitational waves from inspiraling compact\\nbinaries with a network of laser-interferometric detectors having arbitrary\\norientations and arbitrary locations around the globe. The MLM is based on the\\nnetwork likelihood ratio (LR), which is a function of eight signal-parameters\\nthat determine the Newtonian inspiral waveform. In the MLM-based strategy, the\\nLR must be maximized over all of these parameters. Here, we show that it is\\npossible to maximize it analytically over four of the eight parameters.\\nMaximization over a fifth parameter, the time of arrival, is handled most\\nefficiently by using the Fast-Fourier-Transform algorithm. This allows us to\\nscan the parameter space continuously over these five parameters and also cuts\\ndown substantially on the computational costs. Maximization of the LR over the\\nremaining three parameters is handled numerically. This includes the\\nconstruction of a bank of templates on this reduced parameter space.

       "  \"A data-analysis strategy for detecting gravitational-wave signals from inspiraling compact binaries with a network of laser-interferometric detectors. A data-analysis strategy based on the maximum-likelihood method (MLM) is\\npresented for the detection of gravitational waves from inspiraling compact\\nbinaries with a network of laser-interferometric detectors having arbitrary\\norientations and arbitrary locations around the globe. The MLM is based on the\\nnetwork likelihood ratio (LR), which is a function of eight signal-parameters\\nthat determine the Newtonian inspiral waveform. In the MLM-based strategy, the\\nLR must be maximized over all of these parameters. Here, we show that it is\\npossible to maximize it analytically over four of the eight parameters.\\nMaximization over a fifth parameter, the time of arrival, is handled most\\nefficiently by using the Fast-Fourier-Transform algorithm. This allows us to\\nscan the parameter space continuously over these five parameters and also cuts\\ndown substantially on the computational costs. Maximization of the LR over the\\nremaining three parameters is handled numerically. This includes the\\nconstruction of a bank of templates on this reduced parameter space. After\\nobtaining the network statistic, we first discuss `idealized' networks with all\\nthe detectors having a common noise curve for simplicity. Such an exercise\\nnevertheless yields useful estimates about computational costs, and also tests\\nthe formalism developed here. We then consider realistic cases of networks\\ncomprising of the LIGO and VIRGO detectors: These include two-detector\\nnetworks, which pair up the two LIGOs or VIRGO with one of the LIGOs, and the\\nthree-detector network that includes VIRGO and both the LIGOs. For these\\nnetworks we present the computational speed requirements, network\\nsensitivities, and source-direction resolutions.\"],\n",

       "  \"Search templates for gravitational waves from inspiraling binaries: Choice of template spacing. It has long been known that the search for gravitational waves from\\ninspiraling binaries must be aided by signal processing methods, and that the\\ntechnique of matched filtering is the most likely to be used for the detection\\nof inspiral ``chirps''. This means that the output of an interferometer must be\\ncross- correlated with many waveform templates to dig out faint signals buried\\nin the noise. The templates are characterized by several parameters which vary\\ncontinuously over some finite range; but because the amount of computing power\\navailable to perform the cross-correlations of the search templates with the\\noutput is finite, the actual templates used must be picked with certain\\ndiscrete values of these parameters, which will have some finite spacing. If\\nthe spacing is too small, the number of templates (and therefore the computing\\npower) needed to perform an on-line search becomes prohibitive; if the spacing\\nis too large, many chirps will not be detected because the values of their\\nparameters lie too far from those of the nearest template. In this paper I use\\ndifferential geometry to extend the earlier formalism of Sathyaprakash and\\nDhurandhar to estimate the template spacing, number of templates, and computing\\npower required for a single-pass, on-line search of the output of a single\\ninterferometer in terms of the fraction of events lost to parameter\\ndiscretization. My formalism obtains these results with little numerical\\ncomputation, and is valid for arbitrary noise spectra and template\\nparameterizations. I find that the computing power needed for the most\\ncomputationally intensive, reasonable search is of order several hundred\\nGigaflops. This will be feasible by the time LIGO is operational, but it is\\nworth pursuing methods of reducing this number.\"],\n",

Nevertheless, achieving real-time NeRF rendering in\\nlarge-scale scenes has presented challenges, often leading to the adoption of\\neither intricate baked mesh representations with a substantial number of\\ntriangles or resource-intensive ray marching in baked representations.

To further explore this\\nconcept, we have compiled and expanded upon a new dataset called CausalDialogue\\nthrough crowd-sourcing. This dataset includes multiple cause-effect pairs\\nwithin a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure. Our analysis reveals that\\ntraditional loss functions struggle to effectively incorporate the DAG\\nstructure, leading us to propose a causality-enhanced method called Exponential\\nMaximum Average Treatment Effect (ExMATE) to enhance the impact of causality at\\nthe utterance level in training neural conversation models. To evaluate the\\nneeds of considering causality in dialogue generation, we built a comprehensive\\nbenchmark on CausalDialogue dataset using different models, inference, and\\ntraining methods.

A\\ndiscovery of the acceleration of the universe has changed the way we are\\nthinking about the problem of the vacuum energy: Instead of trying to explain\\nwhy it is zero, we are trying to understand why it is anomalously small. Recent\\ncosmological observations have shown that the universe is flat, or almost\\nexactly flat, and confirmed many other predictions of inflationary theory. Many\\nnew versions of this theory have been developed, including hybrid inflation and\\ninflationary models based on string theory.

However, for symmetric\\nencryption methods, the well-known encryption techniques still rely on the key\\nspace to guarantee security and suffer from frequent key updating. Aiming to\\nsolve those problems, this paper proposes a novel text encryption method based\\non deep learning called TEDL, where the secret key includes hyperparameters in\\ndeep learning model and the core step of encryption is transforming input data\\ninto weights trained under hyperparameters. Firstly, both communication parties\\nestablish a word vector table by training a deep learning model according to\\nspecified hyperparameters. Then, a self-update codebook is constructed on the\\nword vector table with the SHA-256 function and other tricks. When\\ncommunication starts, encryption and decryption are equivalent to indexing and\\ninverted indexing on the codebook, respectively, thus achieving the\\ntransformation between plaintext and ciphertext. Results of experiments and\\nrelevant analyses show that TEDL performs well for security, efficiency,\\ngenerality, and has a lower demand for the frequency of key redistribution.\\nEspecially, as a supplement to current encryption methods, the time-consuming\\nprocess of constructing a codebook increases the difficulty of brute-force\\nattacks while not degrade the communication efficiency.'],\n",

Continuous-time Bayesian networks (CTBNs) are graphical representations of\\nmulti-component continuous-time Markov processes as directed graphs. The edges\\nin the network represent direct influences among components. The joint rate\\nmatrix of the multi-component process is specified by means of conditional rate\\nmatrices for each component separately. This paper addresses the situation\\nwhere some of the components evolve on a time scale that is much shorter\\ncompared to the time scale of the other components. In this paper, we prove\\nthat in the limit where the separation of scales is infinite, the Markov\\nprocess converges (in distribution, or weakly) to a reduced, or effective\\nMarkov process that only involves the slow components. We also demonstrate that\\nfor reasonable separation of scale (an order of magnitude) the reduced process\\nis a good approximation of the marginal process over the slow components. We\\nprovide a simple procedure for building a reduced CTBN for this effective\\nprocess, with conditional rate matrices that can be directly calculated from\\nthe original CTBN, and discuss the implications for approximate reasoning in\\nlarge systems.'],\n",

       "  'KANQAS: Kolmogorov-Arnold Network for Quantum Architecture Search. Quantum architecture search (QAS) is a promising direction for optimization\\nand automated design of quantum circuits towards quantum advantage. Recent\\ntechniques in QAS focus on machine learning-based approaches from reinforcement\\nlearning, like deep Q-network. While multi-layer perceptron-based deep\\nQ-networks have been applied for QAS, their interpretability remains\\nchallenging due to the high number of parameters. In this work, we evaluate the\\npracticality of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in QAS problems, analyzing\\ntheir efficiency in the task of quantum state preparation and quantum\\nchemistry. In quantum state preparation, our results show that in a noiseless\\nscenario, the probability of success and the number of optimal quantum circuit\\nconfigurations to generate the multi-qubit maximally entangled states are\\n$2\\\\times$ to $5\\\\times$ higher than Multi-Layer perceptions (MLPs). Moreover, in\\nnoisy scenarios, KAN can achieve a better fidelity in approximating maximally\\nentangled state than MLPs, where the performance of the MLP significantly\\ndepends on the choice of activation function. In tackling quantum chemistry\\nproblems, we enhance the recently proposed QAS algorithm by integrating\\nCurriculum Reinforcement Learning (CRL) with a KAN structure instead of the\\ntraditional MLP. This modification allows us to design a parameterized quantum\\ncircuit that contains fewer 2-qubit gates and has a shallower depth, thereby\\nimproving the efficiency of finding the ground state of a chemical Hamiltonian.\\nFurther investigation reveals that KAN requires a significantly smaller number\\nof learnable parameters compared to MLPs; however, the average time of\\nexecuting each episode for KAN is higher.'],\n",

Image partitioning, or segmentation without semantics, is the task of\\ndecomposing an image into distinct segments, or equivalently to detect closed\\ncontours. Most prior work either requires seeds, one per segment; or a\\nthreshold; or formulates the task as multicut / correlation clustering, an\\nNP-hard problem. Here, we propose an efficient algorithm for graph\\npartitioning, the \"Mutex Watershed\\'\\'. Unlike seeded watershed, the algorithm\\ncan accommodate not only attractive but also repulsive cues, allowing it to\\nfind a previously unspecified number of segments without the need for explicit\\nseeds or a tunable threshold. We also prove that this simple algorithm solves\\nto global optimality an objective function that is intimately related to the\\nmulticut / correlation clustering integer linear programming formulation. The\\nalgorithm is deterministic, very simple to implement, and has empirically\\nlinearithmic complexity. When presented with short-range attractive and\\nlong-range repulsive cues from a deep neural network, the Mutex Watershed gives\\nthe best results currently known for the competitive ISBI 2012 EM segmentation\\nbenchmark.'],\n",

The observations were carried out at zenith\\nangles less than 50 degrees. A new analysis of the Fermi-LAT data was also\\nperformed, including $\\\\sim$14 years of observations. Results: The Crab pulsar\\nphaseogram, long-term light-curve, and phase-resolved spectra are reconstructed\\nwith the LST-1 from 20 GeV to 450 GeV for P1 and up to 700 GeV for P2. The\\npulsed emission is detected with a significance of 15.2$\\\\sigma$. The two\\ncharacteristic emission peaks of the Crab pulsar are clearly detected\\n(>10$\\\\sigma$), as well as the so-called bridge emission (5.7$\\\\sigma$). We find\\nthat both peaks are well described by power laws, with spectral indices of\\n$\\\\sim$3.44 and $\\\\sim$3.03 respectively. The joint analysis of Fermi-LAT and\\nLST-1 data shows a good agreement between both instruments in the overlapping\\nenergy range. The detailed results obtained in the first observations of the\\nCrab pulsar with LST-1 show the potential that CTAO will have to study this\\ntype of sources.'],\n",

       "  \"Emergent World Models and Latent Variable Estimation in Chess-Playing Language Models. Language models have shown unprecedented capabilities, sparking debate over\\nthe source of their performance. Is it merely the outcome of learning syntactic\\npatterns and surface level statistics, or do they extract semantics and a world\\nmodel from the text? Prior work by Li et al. investigated this by training a\\nGPT model on synthetic, randomly generated Othello games and found that the\\nmodel learned an internal representation of the board state. We extend this\\nwork into the more complex domain of chess, training on real games and\\ninvestigating our model's internal representations using linear probes and\\ncontrastive activations. The model is given no a priori knowledge of the game\\nand is solely trained on next character prediction, yet we find evidence of\\ninternal representations of board state. We validate these internal\\nrepresentations by using them to make interventions on the model's activations\\nand edit its internal board state. Unlike Li et al's prior synthetic dataset\\napproach, our analysis finds that the model also learns to estimate latent\\nvariables like player skill to better predict the next character.

       "  'Nonperturbative renormalization group approach to frustrated magnets. This article is devoted to the study of the critical properties of classical\\nXY and Heisenberg frustrated magnets in three dimensions. We first analyze the\\nexperimental and numerical situations. We show that the unusual behaviors\\nencountered in these systems, typically nonuniversal scaling, are hardly\\ncompatible with the hypothesis of a second order phase transition. We then\\nreview the various perturbative and early nonperturbative approaches used to\\ninvestigate these systems. We argue that none of them provides a completely\\nsatisfactory description of the three-dimensional critical behavior. We then\\nrecall the principles of the nonperturbative approach - the effective average\\naction method - that we have used to investigate the physics of frustrated\\nmagnets. First, we recall the treatment of the unfrustrated - O(N) - case with\\nthis method. This allows to introduce its technical aspects. Then, we show how\\nthis method unables to clarify most of the problems encountered in the previous\\ntheoretical descriptions of frustrated magnets.

       "  'Nonperturbative renormalization group approach to frustrated magnets. This article is devoted to the study of the critical properties of classical\\nXY and Heisenberg frustrated magnets in three dimensions. We first analyze the\\nexperimental and numerical situations. We show that the unusual behaviors\\nencountered in these systems, typically nonuniversal scaling, are hardly\\ncompatible with the hypothesis of a second order phase transition. We then\\nreview the various perturbative and early nonperturbative approaches used to\\ninvestigate these systems. We argue that none of them provides a completely\\nsatisfactory description of the three-dimensional critical behavior. We then\\nrecall the principles of the nonperturbative approach - the effective average\\naction method - that we have used to investigate the physics of frustrated\\nmagnets. First, we recall the treatment of the unfrustrated - O(N) - case with\\nthis method. This allows to introduce its technical aspects. Then, we show how\\nthis method unables to clarify most of the problems encountered in the previous\\ntheoretical descriptions of frustrated magnets.

In\\nthis paper, we give a general approach for solving clustering with outliers,\\nwhich results in a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm in $k$ and $m$,\\nthat almost matches the approximation ratio for its outlier-free counterpart.\\nAs a corollary, we obtain FPT approximation algorithms with optimal\\napproximation ratios for $k$-Median and $k$-Means with outliers in general\\nmetrics. We also exhibit more applications of our approach to other variants of\\nthe problem that impose additional constraints on the clustering, such as\\nfairness or matroid constraints.'],\n",

       "  \"Scattering of fermionic isodoublets on the sine-Gordon kink. The scattering of Dirac fermions on the sine-Gordon kink is studied both\\nanalytically and numerically. To achieve invariance with respect to a discrete\\nsymmetry, the sine-Gordon model is treated as a nonlinear $\\\\sigma$-model with a\\ncircular target space that interacts with fermionic isodublets through the\\nYukawa interaction. It is shown that the diagonal and antidiagonal parts of the\\nfermionic wave function interact independently with the external field of the\\nsine-Gordon kink. The wave functions of the fermionic scattering states are\\nexpressed in terms of the Heun functions. General expressions for the\\ntransmission and reflection coefficients are derived, and their dependences on\\nthe fermion momentum and mass are studied numerically. The existence condition\\nis found for two fermionic zero modes, and their analytical expressions are\\nobtained. It is shown that the zero modes do not lead to fragmentation of the\\nfermionic charge, but can lead to polarization of the fermionic vacuum. The\\nscattering of the diagonal and antidiagonal fermionic states is found to be\\nsignificantly different; this difference is shown to be due to the different\\ndependences of the energy levels of these bound states on the fermion mass, and\\nis in accordance with Levinson's theorem.\"],\n",

This paper proposes new attacks that take advantage\\nof one or more model updates to improve MI. A key part of our approach is to\\nleverage rich information from standalone MI attacks mounted separately against\\nthe original and updated models, and to combine this information in specific\\nways to improve attack effectiveness. We propose a set of combination functions\\nand tuning methods for each, and present both analytical and quantitative\\njustification for various options. Our results on four public datasets show\\nthat our attacks are effective at using update information to give the\\nadversary a significant advantage over attacks on standalone models, but also\\ncompared to a prior MI attack that takes advantage of model updates in a\\nrelated machine-unlearning setting.

These solutions depend on two extra parameters, other\\nthan the mass and the NUT charge, which are the electric charge $q$ and the\\nelectric potential at infinity $V$. We find that the form of metric is\\nsensitive to geometry of the base space, while the form of electromagnetic\\nfield is independent of $\\\\mathcal{B}$. We investigate the existence of\\nTaub-NUT/bolt solutions and find that in addition to the two conditions of\\nuncharged NUT solutions, there exist two other conditions. These two extra\\nconditions come from the regularity of vector potential at $r=N$ and the fact\\nthat the horizon at $r=N$ should be the outer horizon of the black hole. We\\nfind that for all non-extremal NUT solutions of Einstein gravity having no\\ncurvature singularity at $r=N$, there exist NUT solutions in\\nGauss-Bonnet-Maxwell gravity. Indeed, we have non-extreme NUT solutions in\\n$2+2k$ dimensions only when the $2k$-dimensional base space is chosen to be\\n$\\\\mathbb{CP}^{2k}$. We also find that the Gauss-Bonnet-Maxwell gravity has\\nextremal NUT solutions whenever the base space is a product of 2-torii with at\\nmost a 2-dimensional factor space of positive curvature, even though there a\\ncurvature singularity exists at $r=N$. We also find that one can have bolt\\nsolutions in Gauss-Bonnet-Maxwell gravity with any base space. The only case\\nfor which one does not have black hole solutions is in the absence of a\\ncosmological term with zero curvature base space.'],\n",

       "  \"An open-source tool to assess the carbon footprint of research. Research institutions are bound to contribute to greenhouse gas emission\\n(GHG) reduction efforts for several reasons. First, part of the scientific\\ncommunity's research deals with climate change issues. Second, scientists\\ncontribute to students' education: they must be consistent and role models.\\nThird the literature on the carbon footprint of researchers points to the high\\nlevel of some individual footprints. In a quest for consistency and role\\nmodels, scientists, teams of scientists or universities have started to\\nquantify their carbon footprints and debate on reduction options. Indeed,\\nmeasuring the carbon footprint of research activities requires tools designed\\nto tackle its specific features. In this paper, we present an open-source web\\napplication, GES 1point5, developed by an interdisciplinary team of scientists\\nfrom several research labs in France. GES 1point5 is specifically designed to\\nestimate the carbon footprint of research activities in France. It operates at\\nthe scale of research labs, i.e. laboratoires, which are the social structures\\naround which research is organized in France and the smallest decision making\\nentities in the French research system. The application allows French research\\nlabs to compute their own carbon footprint along a standardized, open protocol.\\nThe data collected in a rapidly growing network of labs will be used as part of\\nthe Labos 1point5 project to estimate France's research carbon footprint. At\\nthe time of submitting this manuscript, 89 research labs had engaged with GES\\n1point5 to estimate their greenhouse gas emissions.

We also\\ninvestigate the trade-off between the overall power consumption and occupied\\nmidhaul bandwidth in the network. Our results demonstrate that functional\\nsplitting together with enabling caching at edge clouds reduces not only\\ncontent access delays but also fronthaul bandwidth consumption but at the\\nexpense of higher power consumption.'],\n",

Calculations are presented of the in-plane far-infrared conductivity of a\\nd_{x^2-y^2}-wave superconductor, incorporating elastic scattering due to\\nimpurities and inelastic scattering due to spin fluctuations. The impurity\\nscattering is modeled by short-range potential scattering with arbitrary phase\\nshift, while scattering due to spin fluctuations is calculated within a\\nweak-coupling Hubbard model picture. The conductivity is characterized by a\\nlow-temperature residual Drude feature whose height and weight are controlled\\nby impurity scattering, as well as a broad peak centered at 4 Delta_0 arising\\nfrom clean-limit inelastic processes. Results are in qualitative agreement with\\nexperiment despite missing spectral weight at high energies.',\n",

The\\nmost prominent features in the magnetic spectra include a spin gap in the\\nsuperconducting state, a pseudogap in the normal state, the much-discussed\\nresonance, and incommensurate spin fluctuations below the resonance. We\\nestablish the doping dependence of the spin gap in the superconducting state,\\nthe resonance energy, and the incommensurability of the spin fluctuations. We\\ndiscuss in detail the procedure used for separating the magnetic scattering\\nfrom phonon and other spurious effects. In the comparison of our experimental\\nresults with various microscopic theoretical models, particular emphasis was\\nmade to address the similarities and differences in the spin fluctuations of\\nYBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+x}$ and La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.'],\n",
