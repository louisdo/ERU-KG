        "hiv treatment as prevention: systematic comparison of mathematical models of the potential impact of antiretroviral therapy on hiv incidence in south africa. background many mathematical models have investigated the impact of expanding access to antiretroviral therapy (art) on new hiv infections. comparing results and conclusions across models is challenging because models have addressed slightly different questions and have reported different outcome metrics. this study compares the predictions of several mathematical models simulating the same art intervention programmes to determine the extent to which models agree about the epidemiological impact of expanded art. methods and findings twelve independent mathematical models evaluated a set of standardised art intervention scenarios in south africa and reported a common set of outputs. intervention scenarios systematically varied the cd4 count threshold for treatment eligibility, access to treatment, and programme retention. for a scenario in which 80% of hiv-infected individuals start treatment on average 1 y after their cd4 count drops below 350 cells/\u00b5l and 85% remain on treatment after 3 y, the models projected that hiv incidence would be 35% to 54% lower 8 y after the introduction of art, compared to a counterfactual scenario in which there is no art. more variation existed in the estimated long-term (38 y) reductions in incidence. the impact of optimistic interventions including immediate art initiation varied widely across models, maintaining substantial uncertainty about the theoretical prospect for elimination of hiv from the population using art alone over the next four decades. the number of person-years of art per infection averted over 8 y ranged between 5.8 and 18.7. considering the actual scale-up of art in south africa, seven models estimated that current hiv incidence is 17% to 32% lower than it would have been in the absence of art. differences between model assumptions about cd4 decline and hiv transmissibility over the course of infection explained only a modest amount of the variation in model results. conclusions mathematical models evaluating the impact of art vary substantially in structure, complexity, and parameter choices, but all suggest that art, at high levels of access and with high adherence, has the potential to substantially reduce new hiv infections. there was broad agreement regarding the short-term epidemiologic impact of ambitious treatment scale-up, but more variation in longer term projections and in the efficiency with which treatment can reduce new infections. differences between model predictions could not be explained by differences in model structure or parameterization that were hypothesized to affect intervention impact."

        "elimination of hiv in south africa through expanded access to antiretroviral therapy: a model comparison study. background expanded access to antiretroviral therapy (art) using universal test and treat (utt) has been suggested as a strategy to eliminate hiv in south africa within 7 y based on an influential mathematical modeling study. however, the underlying deterministic model was criticized widely, and other modeling studies did not always confirm the study's finding. the objective of our study is to better understand the implications of different model structures and assumptions, so as to arrive at the best possible predictions of the long-term impact of utt and the possibility of elimination of hiv. methods and findings we developed nine structurally different mathematical models of the south african hiv epidemic in a stepwise approach of increasing complexity and realism. the simplest model resembles the initial deterministic model, while the most comprehensive model is the stochastic microsimulation model stdsim, which includes sexual networks and hiv stages with different degrees of infectiousness. we defined utt as annual screening and immediate art for all hiv-infected adults, starting at 13% in january 2012 and scaled up to 90% coverage by january 2019. all models predict elimination, yet those that capture more processes underlying the hiv transmission dynamics predict elimination at a later point in time, after 20 to 25 y. importantly, the most comprehensive model predicts that the current strategy of art at cd4 count \u2264350 cells/\u00b5l will also lead to elimination, albeit 10 y later compared to utt. still, utt remains cost-effective, as many additional life-years would be saved. the study's major limitations are that elimination was defined as incidence below 1/1,000 person-years rather than 0% prevalence, and drug resistance was not modeled. conclusions our results confirm previous predictions that the hiv epidemic in south africa can be eliminated through universal testing and immediate treatment at 90% coverage. however, more realistic models show that elimination is likely to occur at a much later point in time than the initial model suggested. also, utt is a cost-effective intervention, but less cost-effective than previously predicted because the current south african art treatment policy alone could already drive hiv into elimination. please see later in the article for the editors' summary."

        "cost-effectiveness of options for the diagnosis of high blood pressure in primary care: a modelling study.. background the diagnosis of hypertension has traditionally been based on blood-pressure measurements in the clinic, but home and ambulatory measurements better correlate with cardiovascular outcome, and ambulatory monitoring is more accurate than both clinic and home monitoring in diagnosing hypertension. we aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of different diagnostic strategies for hypertension. methods we did a markov model-based probabilistic cost-effectiveness analysis. we used a hypothetical primary-care population aged 40 years or older with a screening blood-pressure measurement greater than 140/90 mm hg and risk-factor prevalence equivalent to the general population. we compared three diagnostic strategies-further blood pressure measurement in the clinic, at home, and with an ambulatory monitor-in terms of lifetime costs, quality-adjusted life years, and cost-effectiveness. findings ambulatory monitoring was the most cost-effective strategy for the diagnosis of hypertension for men and women of all ages. it was cost-saving for all groups (from -\u00a356 [95% ci -105 to -10] in men aged 75 years to -\u00a3323 [-389 to -222] in women aged 40 years) and resulted in more quality-adjusted life years for men and women older than 50 years (from 0\u00b7006 [0\u00b7000 to 0\u00b7015] for women aged 60 years to 0\u00b7022 [0\u00b7012 to 0\u00b7035] for men aged 70 years). this finding was robust when assessed with a wide range of deterministic sensitivity analyses around the base case, but was sensitive if home monitoring was judged to have equal test performance to ambulatory monitoring or if treatment was judged effective irrespective of whether an individual was hypertensive. interpretation ambulatory monitoring as a diagnostic strategy for hypertension after an initial raised reading in the clinic would reduce misdiagnosis and save costs. additional costs from ambulatory monitoring are counterbalanced by cost savings from better targeted treatment. ambulatory monitoring is recommended for most patients before the start of antihypertensive drugs. funding national institute for health research and the national institute for health and clinical excellence."

        "intrauterine factors and risk of breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis of current evidence.. background emerging evidence suggests an association between female prenatal experience and her subsequent risk of developing breast cancer. potential underlying mechanisms include variation in amounts of maternal endogenous sex hormones and growth hormones, germ-cell mutations, formation of cancer stem-cells, and other genetic or epigenetic events. we reviewed and summarised quantitatively the available data on intrauterine exposures and risk of breast cancer. methods we systematically searched for studies that assessed association between perinatal factors and risk of breast cancer. we reviewed separately each of the perinatal factors, including birthweight, birth length, parental age at delivery, gestational age, intrauterine exposure to diethylstilbestrol, twin membership, maternal pre-eclampsia or eclampsia, and other factors. findings we identified 57 studies published between oct 1, 1980, and june 21, 2007. increased risk of breast cancer was noted with increased birthweight (relative risk [rr] 1.15 [95% ci 1.09-1.21]), birth length (1.28 [1.11-1.48]), higher maternal age (1.13 [1.02-1.25]), and paternal age (1.12 [1.05-1.19]). decreased risk of breast cancer was noted for maternal pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (0.48 [0.30-0.78]) and twin membership (0.93 [0.87-1.00]). no association was noted between risk of breast cancer and gestational age at birth (0.95 [0.71-1.26]) or maternal diethylstilbestrol treatment (1.40 [0.86-2.28]). interpretation the intrauterine environment contributes to the predisposition of women to breast cancer in adulthood. the in-utero mechanisms responsible for such predisposition need to be elucidated."

        "intrauterine environments and breast cancer risk: meta-analysis and systematic review. introduction various perinatal factors, including birth weight, birth order, maternal age, gestational age, twin status, and parental smoking, have been postulated to affect breast cancer risk in daughters by altering the hormonal environment of the developing fetal mammary glands. despite ample biologic plausibility, epidemiologic studies to date have yielded conflicting results. we investigated the associations between perinatal factors and subsequent breast cancer risk through meta-analyses. methods we reviewed breast cancer studies published from january 1966 to february 2007 that included data on birth weight, birth order, maternal age, gestational age, twin status, and maternal or paternal smoking. meta-analyses using random effect models were employed to summarize the results. results we found that heavier birth weights were associated with increased breast cancer risk, with studies involving five categories of birth weight identifying odds ratios (ors) of 1.24 (95% confidence interval [ci] 1.04 to 1.48) for 4,000 g or more and 1.15 (95% ci 1.04 to 1.26) for 3,500 g to 3,999 g, relative to a birth weight of 2,500 to 2,599 g. these studies provided no support for a j-shaped relationship of birthweight to risk. support for an association with birthweight was also derived from studies based on three birth weight categories (or 1.15 [95% ci 1.01 to 1.31] for > or =4,000 g relative to <3,000 g) and two birth weight categories (or 1.09 [95% ci 1.02 to 1.18] for > or =3,000 g relative to <3,000 g). women born to older mothers and twins were also at some increased risk, but the results were heterogeneous across studies and publication years. birth order, prematurity, and maternal smoking were unrelated to breast cancer risk. conclusion our findings provide some support for the hypothesis that in utero exposures reflective of higher endogenous hormone levels could affect risk for development of breast cancer in adulthood."

        "antibody-based hiv-1 vaccines: recent developments and future directions. the global hiv vaccine enterprise convened a two-day workshop in may of 2007 to discuss humoral immune responses to hiv and approaches to design vaccines that induce viral neutralizing and other potentially protective antibody responses. the goals of this workshop were to identify key scientific issues, gaps, and opportunities that have emerged since the enterprise strategic plan was first published in 2005 [1], and to make recommendations that enterprise stakeholders can use to plan new activities. most effective viral vaccines work, at least in part, by generating antibodies that inactivate or neutralize the invading virus, and the existing data strongly suggest that an optimally effective hiv-1 vaccine should elicit potent antiviral neutralizing antibodies. however, unlike acute viral pathogens, hiv-1 chronically replicates in the host and evades the antibody response. this immune evasion, along with the large genetic variation among hiv-1 strains worldwide, has posed major obstacles to vaccine development. current hiv vaccine candidates do not elicit neutralizing antibodies against most circulating virus strains, and thus the induction of a protective antibody response remains a major priority for hiv-1 vaccine development. for an antibody-based hiv-1 vaccine, progress in vaccine design is generally gauged by in vitro assays that measure the ability of vaccine-induced antibodies to neutralize a broad spectrum of viral isolates representing the major genetic subtypes (clades) of hiv-1 [2]. although it is not known what magnitude and breadth of neutralization will predict protection in vaccine recipients, it is clear that current vaccine immunogens elicit antibodies that neutralize only a minority of circulating isolates. thus, much progress needs to be made in this area. also, though virus neutralization is considered a critical benchmark for a vaccine, this may not be the only benchmark for predicting success with antibody-based hiv-1 vaccine immunogens. the main targets for neutralizing antibodies to hiv-1 are the surface gp120 and trans-membrane gp41 envelope glycoproteins (env) that mediate receptor and coreceptor binding and the subsequent membrane fusion events that allow the virus to gain entry into cells [3]. antibodies neutralize the virus by binding these viral spikes and blocking virus entry into susceptible cells, such as cd4+ t cells [4,5]. in order to chronically replicate in the host, the virus exploits several mechanisms to shield itself against antibody recognition, including a dense outer coating of sugar molecules (n-linked glycans) and the strategic positioning of cysteine\u2013cysteine loop structures on the gp120 molecule [6\u20138]. these shielding mechanisms, although highly effective, have vulnerabilities imposed by fitness constraints. information on the precise location and molecular structure of these vulnerable regions could be valuable for the rational design of improved vaccine immunogens. participants in the workshop identified four areas that, if given proper attention, could provide key information that would bring the field closer to an effective antibody-based hiv-1 vaccine: (1) structure-assisted immunogen design, (2) role of fc receptors and complement, (3) assay standardization and validation, and (4) immunoregulation of b cell responses."

        "cnn1 inhibits the interactions between the kmn complexes of the yeast kinetochore. kinetochores attach the replicated chromosomes to the mitotic spindle and orchestrate their transmission to the daughter cells. kinetochore\u2013spindle binding and chromosome segregation are mediated by the multi-copy knl1spc105, mis12mtw1 and ndc80ndc80 complexes that form the so-called kmn network. kmn\u2013spindle attachment is regulated by the aurora bipl1 and mps1mps1 kinases. it is unclear whether other mechanisms exist that support kmn activity during the cell cycle. using budding yeast, we show that kinetochore protein cnn1 localizes to the base of the ndc80 complex and promotes a functionally competent configuration of the kmn network. cnn1 regulates kmn activity in a spatiotemporal manner by inhibiting the interaction between its complexes. cnn1 activity peaks in anaphase and is driven by the cdc28, mps1 and ipl1 kinases."

        "a clinical approach to circadian rhythm sleep disorders.. circadian rhythm sleep disorders are characterized by complaints of insomnia and excessive sleepiness that are primarily due to alterations in the internal circadian timing system or a misalignment between the timing of sleep and the 24-h social and physical environment. in addition to physiological and environmental factors, maladaptive behaviors often play an important role in the development of many of the circadian rhythm sleep disorders. this review will focus on the clinical approach to the diagnosis and management of the various circadian rhythm sleep disorders, including delayed sleep phase disorder, advanced sleep phase disorder, non-entrained type, irregular sleep-wake rhythm, shift work sleep disorder and jet lag disorder. diagnostic tools such as sleep diaries and wrist activity monitoring are often useful in confirming the diagnosis. because behavioral and environmental factors often are involved in the development of these conditions, a multimodal approach is usually necessary. interventions include sleep hygiene education, timed exposure to bright light as well as avoidance of bright light at the wrong time of the day and pharmacologic approaches, such as melatonin. however, it should be noted that the use of melatonin is not an fda-approved indication for the treatment of circadian rhythm sleep disorders."

        "a comparison of cost effectiveness using data from randomized trials or actual clinical practice: selective cox-2 inhibitors as an example. background data on absolute risks of outcomes and patterns of drug use in cost-effectiveness analyses are often based on randomised clinical trials (rcts). the objective of this study was to evaluate the external validity of published cost-effectiveness studies by comparing the data used in these studies (typically based on rcts) to observational data from actual clinical practice. selective cox-2 inhibitors (coxibs) were used as an example. methods and findings the uk general practice research database (gprd) was used to estimate the exposure characteristics and individual probabilities of upper gastrointestinal (gi) events during current exposure to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (nsaids) or coxibs. a basic cost-effectiveness model was developed evaluating two alternative strategies: prescription of a conventional nsaid or coxib. outcomes included upper gi events as recorded in gprd and hospitalisation for upper gi events recorded in the national registry of hospitalisations (hospital episode statistics) linked to gprd. prescription costs were based on the prescribed number of tables as recorded in gprd and the 2006 cost data from the british national formulary. the study population included over 1 million patients prescribed conventional nsaids or coxibs. only a minority of patients used the drugs long-term and daily (34.5% of conventional nsaids and 44.2% of coxibs), whereas coxib rcts required daily use for at least 6-9 months. the mean cost of preventing one upper gi event as recorded in gprd was us$104k (ranging from us$64k with long-term daily use to us$182k with intermittent use) and us$298k for hospitalizations. the mean costs (for gprd events) over calendar time were us$58k during 1990-1993 and us$174k during 2002-2005. using rct data rather than gprd data for event probabilities, the mean cost was us$16k with the vigor rct and us$20k with the class rct. conclusions the published cost-effectiveness analyses of coxibs lacked external validity, did not represent patients in actual clinical practice, and should not have been used to inform prescribing policies. external validity should be an explicit requirement for cost-effectiveness analyses."

        "mapping meiotic single-strand dna reveals a new landscape of dna double-strand breaks in saccharomyces cerevisiae. dna double-strand breaks (dsbs), which are formed by the spo11 protein, initiate meiotic recombination. previous dsb-mapping studies have used rad50s or sae2\u03b4 mutants, which are defective in break processing, to accumulate spo11-linked dsbs, and report large (\u2265 50 kb) \u201cdsb-hot\u201d regions that are separated by \u201cdsb-cold\u201d domains of similar size. substantial recombination occurs in some dsb-cold regions, suggesting that dsb patterns are not normal in rad50s or sae2\u03b4 mutants. we therefore developed a novel method to map genome-wide, single-strand dna (ssdna)\u2013associated dsbs that accumulate in processing-capable, repair-defective dmc1\u03b4 and dmc1\u03b4 rad51\u03b4 mutants. dsbs were observed at known hot spots, but also in most previously identified \u201cdsb-cold\u201d regions, including near centromeres and telomeres. although approximately 40% of the genome is dsb-cold in rad50s mutants, analysis of meiotic ssdna from dmc1\u03b4 shows that most of these regions have substantial dsb activity. southern blot assays of dsbs in selected regions in dmc1\u03b4, rad50s, and wild-type cells confirm these findings. thus, dsbs are distributed much more uniformly than was previously believed. comparisons of dsb signals in dmc1, dmc1 rad51, and dmc1 spo11 mutant strains identify dmc1 as a critical strand-exchange activity genome-wide, and confirm previous conclusions that spo11-induced lesions initiate all meiotic recombination."

        "cyclin a regulates kinetochore-microtubules to promote faithful chromosome segregation. the most conspicuous event in the cell cycle is the alignment of chromosomes in metaphase. chromosome alignment fosters faithful segregation through the formation of bi-oriented attachments of kinetochores to spindle microtubules. notably, numerous kinetochore-microtubule (k-mt) attachment errors are present in early mitosis (prometaphase), and the persistence of those errors is the leading cause of chromosome mis-segregation in aneuploid human tumour cells that continually mis-segregate whole chromosomes and display chromosomal instability. how robust error correction is achieved in prometaphase to ensure error-free mitosis remains unknown. here we show that k-mt attachments in prometaphase cells are considerably less stable than in metaphase cells. the switch to more stable k-mt attachments in metaphase requires the proteasome-dependent destruction of cyclin a in prometaphase. persistent cyclin a expression prevents k-mt stabilization even in cells with aligned chromosomes. by contrast, k-mts are prematurely stabilized in cyclin-a-deficient cells. consequently, cells lacking cyclin a display higher rates of chromosome mis-segregation. thus, the stability of k-mt attachments increases decisively in a coordinated fashion among all chromosomes as cells transit from prometaphase to metaphase. cyclin a creates a cellular environment that promotes microtubule detachment from kinetochores in prometaphase to ensure efficient error correction and faithful chromosome segregation."

        "role of dna methylation and epigenetic silencing of hand2 in endometrial cancer development. background endometrial cancer incidence is continuing to rise in the wake of the current ageing and obesity epidemics. much of the risk for endometrial cancer development is influenced by the environment and lifestyle. accumulating evidence suggests that the epigenome serves as the interface between the genome and the environment and that hypermethylation of stem cell polycomb group target genes is an epigenetic hallmark of cancer. the objective of this study was to determine the functional role of epigenetic factors in endometrial cancer development. methods and findings epigenome-wide methylation analysis of >27,000 cpg sites in endometrial cancer tissue samples (n = 64) and control samples (n = 23) revealed that hand2 (a gene encoding a transcription factor expressed in the endometrial stroma) is one of the most commonly hypermethylated and silenced genes in endometrial cancer. a novel integrative epigenome-transcriptome-interactome analysis further revealed that hand2 is the hub of the most highly ranked differential methylation hotspot in endometrial cancer. these findings were validated using candidate gene methylation analysis in multiple clinical sample sets of tissue samples from a total of 272 additional women. increased hand2 methylation was a feature of premalignant endometrial lesions and was seen to parallel a decrease in rna and protein levels. furthermore, women with high endometrial hand2 methylation in their premalignant lesions were less likely to respond to progesterone treatment. hand2 methylation analysis of endometrial secretions collected using high vaginal swabs taken from women with postmenopausal bleeding specifically identified those patients with early stage endometrial cancer with both high sensitivity and high specificity (receiver operating characteristics area under the curve = 0.91 for stage 1a and 0.97 for higher than stage 1a). finally, mice harbouring a hand2 knock-out specifically in their endometrium were shown to develop precancerous endometrial lesions with increasing age, and these lesions also demonstrated a lack of pten expression. conclusions hand2 methylation is a common and crucial molecular alteration in endometrial cancer that could potentially be employed as a biomarker for early detection of endometrial cancer and as a predictor of treatment response. the true clinical utility of hand2 dna methylation, however, requires further validation in prospective studies. please see later in the article for the editors' summary."

        "global, regional, and national comparative risk assessment of 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks, 1990\u20132015: a systematic analysis for the global burden of disease study 2015. background the global burden of diseases, injuries, and risk factors study 2015 provides an up-to-date synthesis of the evidence for risk factor exposure and the attributable burden of disease. by providing national and subnational assessments spanning the past 25 years, this study can inform debates on the importance of addressing risks in context. methods we used the comparative risk assessment framework developed for previous iterations of the global burden of disease study to estimate attributable deaths, disability-adjusted life-years (dalys), and trends in exposure by age group, sex, year, and geography for 79 behavioural, environmental and occupational, and metabolic risks or clusters of risks from 1990 to 2015. this study included 388 risk-outcome pairs that met world cancer research fund-defined criteria for convincing or probable evidence. we extracted relative risk and exposure estimates from randomised controlled trials, cohorts, pooled cohorts, household surveys, census data, satellite data, and other sources. we used statistical models to pool data, adjust for bias, and incorporate covariates. we developed a metric that allows comparisons of exposure across risk factors-the summary exposure value. using the counterfactual scenario of theoretical minimum risk level, we estimated the portion of deaths and dalys that could be attributed to a given risk. we decomposed trends in attributable burden into contributions from population growth, population age structure, risk exposure, and risk-deleted cause-specific daly rates. we characterised risk exposure in relation to a socio-demographic index (sdi). findings between 1990 and 2015, global exposure to unsafe sanitation, household air pollution, childhood underweight, childhood stunting, and smoking each decreased by more than 25%. global exposure for several occupational risks, high body-mass index (bmi), and drug use increased by more than 25% over the same period. all risks jointly evaluated in 2015 accounted for 57\u00b78% (95% ci 56\u00b76-58\u00b78) of global deaths and 41\u00b72% (39\u00b78-42\u00b78) of dalys. in 2015, the ten largest contributors to global dalys among level 3 risks were high systolic blood pressure (211\u00b78 million [192\u00b77 million to 231\u00b71 million] global dalys), smoking (148\u00b76 million [134\u00b72 million to 163\u00b71 million]), high fasting plasma glucose (143\u00b71 million [125\u00b71 million to 163\u00b75 million]), high bmi (120\u00b71 million [83\u00b78 million to 158\u00b74 million]), childhood undernutrition (113\u00b73 million [103\u00b79 million to 123\u00b74 million]), ambient particulate matter (103\u00b71 million [90\u00b78 million to 115\u00b71 million]), high total cholesterol (88\u00b77 million [74\u00b76 million to 105\u00b77 million]), household air pollution (85\u00b76 million [66\u00b77 million to 106\u00b71 million]), alcohol use (85\u00b70 million [77\u00b72 million to 93\u00b70 million]), and diets high in sodium (83\u00b70 million [49\u00b73 million to 127\u00b75 million]). from 1990 to 2015, attributable dalys declined for micronutrient deficiencies, childhood undernutrition, unsafe sanitation and water, and household air pollution; reductions in risk-deleted daly rates rather than reductions in exposure drove these declines. rising exposure contributed to notable increases in attributable dalys from high bmi, high fasting plasma glucose, occupational carcinogens, and drug use. environmental risks and childhood undernutrition declined steadily with sdi; low physical activity, high bmi, and high fasting plasma glucose increased with sdi. in 119 countries, metabolic risks, such as high bmi and fasting plasma glucose, contributed the most attributable dalys in 2015. regionally, smoking still ranked among the leading five risk factors for attributable dalys in 109 countries; childhood underweight and unsafe sex remained primary drivers of early death and disability in much of sub-saharan africa. interpretation declines in some key environmental risks have contributed to declines in critical infectious diseases. some risks appear to be invariant to sdi. increasing risks, including high bmi, high fasting plasma glucose, drug use, and some occupational exposures, contribute to rising burden from some conditions, but also provide opportunities for intervention. some highly preventable risks, such as smoking, remain major causes of attributable dalys, even as exposure is declining. public policy makers need to pay attention to the risks that are increasingly major contributors to global burden. funding bill & melinda gates foundation."

        "fact disrupts nucleosome structure by binding h2a-h2b with conserved peptide motifs.. fact, a heterodimer of spt16 and pob3, is an essential histone chaperone. we show that the h2a-h2b binding activity that is central to fact function resides in short acidic regions near the c termini of each subunit. mutations throughout these regions affect binding and cause correlated phenotypes that range from mild to lethal, with the largest individual contributions unexpectedly coming from an aromatic residue and a nearby carboxylate residue within each domain. spt16 and pob3 bind overlapping sites on h2a-h2b, and spt16-pob3 heterodimers simultaneously bind two h2a-h2b dimers, the same stoichiometry as the components of a nucleosome. an spt16:h2a-h2b crystal structure explains the biochemical and genetic data, provides a model for pob3 binding, and implies a mechanism for fact reorganization that we confirm biochemically. moreover, unexpected similarity to binding of anp32e and swr1 with h2a.z-h2b reveals that diverse h2a-h2b chaperones use common mechanisms of histone binding and regulating nucleosome functions."

        "foxk proteins repress the initiation of starvation-induced atrophy and autophagy programs. autophagy is the primary catabolic process triggered in response to starvation. although autophagic regulation within the cytosolic compartment is well established, it is becoming clear that nuclear events also regulate the induction or repression of autophagy. nevertheless, a thorough understanding of the mechanisms by which sequence-specific transcription factors modulate expression of genes required for autophagy is lacking. here, we identify foxk proteins (foxk1 and foxk2) as transcriptional repressors of autophagy in muscle cells and fibroblasts. interestingly, foxk1/2 serve to counter-balance another forkhead transcription factor, foxo3, which induces an overlapping set of autophagic and atrophic targets in muscle. foxk1/2 specifically recruits sin3a-hdac complexes to restrict acetylation of histone h4 and expression of critical autophagy genes. remarkably, mtor promotes the transcriptional activity of foxk1 by facilitating nuclear entry to specifically limit basal levels of autophagy in nutrient-rich conditions. our study highlights an ancient, conserved mechanism whereby nutritional status is interpreted by mtor to restrict autophagy by repressing essential autophagy genes through foxk-sin3-mediated transcriptional control."

        "reversal of the cellular phenotype in the premature aging disease hutchinson-gilford progeria syndrome. hutchinson-gilford progeria syndrome (hgps) is a childhood premature aging disease caused by a spontaneous point mutation in lamin a (encoded by lmna), one of the major architectural elements of the mammalian cell nucleus. the hgps mutation activates an aberrant cryptic splice site in lmna pre-mrna, leading to synthesis of a truncated lamin a protein and concomitant reduction in wild-type lamin a. fibroblasts from individuals with hgps have severe morphological abnormalities in nuclear envelope structure. here we show that the cellular disease phenotype is reversible in cells from individuals with hgps. introduction of wild-type lamin a protein does not rescue the cellular disease symptoms. the mutant lmna mrna and lamin a protein can be efficiently eliminated by correction of the aberrant splicing event using a modified oligonucleotide targeted to the activated cryptic splice site. upon splicing correction, hgps fibroblasts assume normal nuclear morphology, the aberrant nuclear distribution and cellular levels of lamina-associated proteins are rescued, defects in heterochromatin-specific histone modifications are corrected and proper expression of several misregulated genes is reestablished. our results establish proof of principle for the correction of the premature aging phenotype in individuals with hgps."

        "an excitatory loop with astrocytes contributes to drive neurons to seizure threshold. seizures in focal epilepsies are sustained by a highly synchronous neuronal discharge that arises at restricted brain sites and subsequently spreads to large portions of the brain. despite intense experimental research in this field, the earlier cellular events that initiate and sustain a focal seizure are still not well defined. their identification is central to understand the pathophysiology of focal epilepsies and to develop new pharmacological therapies for drug-resistant forms of epilepsy. the prominent involvement of astrocytes in ictogenesis was recently proposed. we test here whether a cooperation between astrocytes and neurons is a prerequisite to support ictal (seizure-like) and interictal epileptiform events. simultaneous patch-clamp recording and ca2+ imaging techniques were performed in a new in vitro model of focal seizures induced by local applications of n-methyl-d-aspartic acid (nmda) in rat entorhinal cortex slices. we found that a ca2+ elevation in astrocytes correlates with both the initial development and the maintenance of a focal, seizure-like discharge. a delayed astrocyte activation during ictal discharges was also observed in other models (including the whole in vitro isolated guinea pig brain) in which the site of generation of seizure activity cannot be precisely monitored. in contrast, interictal discharges were not associated with ca2+ changes in astrocytes. selective inhibition or stimulation of astrocyte ca2+ signalling blocked or enhanced, respectively, ictal discharges, but did not affect interictal discharge generation. our data reveal that neurons engage astrocytes in a recurrent excitatory loop (possibly involving gliotransmission) that promotes seizure ignition and sustains the ictal discharge. this neuron-astrocyte interaction may represent a novel target to develop effective therapeutic strategies to control seizures."

        "interleukin-6 receptor pathways in coronary heart disease: a collaborative meta-analysis of 82 studies. background persistent inflammation has been proposed to contribute to various stages in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. interleukin-6 receptor (il6r) signalling propagates downstream inflammation cascades. to assess whether this pathway is causally relevant to coronary heart disease, we studied a functional genetic variant known to affect il6r signalling. methods in a collaborative meta-analysis, we studied asp358ala (rs2228145) in il6r in relation to a panel of conventional risk factors and inflammation biomarkers in 125,222 participants. we also compared the frequency of asp358ala in 51,441 patients with coronary heart disease and in 136,226 controls. to gain insight into possible mechanisms, we assessed asp358ala in relation to localised gene expression and to postlipopolysaccharide stimulation of interleukin 6. findings the minor allele frequency of asp358ala was 39%. asp358ala was not associated with lipid concentrations, blood pressure, adiposity, dysglycaemia, or smoking (p value for association per minor allele \u22650\u00b704 for each). by contrast, for every copy of 358ala inherited, mean concentration of il6r increased by 34\u00b73% (95% ci 30\u00b74-38\u00b72) and of interleukin 6 by 14\u00b76% (10\u00b77-18\u00b74), and mean concentration of c-reactive protein was reduced by 7\u00b75% (5\u00b79-9\u00b71) and of fibrinogen by 1\u00b70% (0\u00b77-1\u00b73). for every copy of 358ala inherited, risk of coronary heart disease was reduced by 3\u00b74% (1\u00b78-5\u00b70). asp358ala was not related to il6r mrna levels or interleukin-6 production in monocytes. interpretation large-scale human genetic and biomarker data are consistent with a causal association between il6r-related pathways and coronary heart disease. funding british heart foundation; uk medical research council; uk national institute of health research, cambridge biomedical research centre; bupa foundation."

        "radiation and dual checkpoint blockade activates non-redundant immune mechanisms in cancer. immune checkpoint inhibitors result in impressive clinical responses, but optimal results will require combination with each other and other therapies. this raises fundamental questions about mechanisms of non-redundancy and resistance. here we report major tumour regressions in a subset of patients with metastatic melanoma treated with an anti-ctla4 antibody (anti-ctla4) and radiation, and reproduced this effect in mouse models. although combined treatment improved responses in irradiated and unirradiated tumours, resistance was common. unbiased analyses of mice revealed that resistance was due to upregulation of pd-l1 on melanoma cells and associated with t-cell exhaustion. accordingly, optimal response in melanoma and other cancer types requires radiation, anti-ctla4 and anti-pd-l1/pd-1. anti-ctla4 predominantly inhibits t-regulatory cells (treg cells), thereby increasing the cd8 t-cell to treg (cd8/treg) ratio. radiation enhances the diversity of the t-cell receptor (tcr) repertoire of intratumoral t cells. together, anti-ctla4 promotes expansion of t cells, while radiation shapes the tcr repertoire of the expanded peripheral clones. addition of pd-l1 blockade reverses t-cell exhaustion to mitigate depression in the cd8/treg ratio and further encourages oligoclonal t-cell expansion. similarly to results from mice, patients on our clinical trial with melanoma showing high pd-l1 did not respond to radiation plus anti-ctla4, demonstrated persistent t-cell exhaustion, and rapidly progressed. thus, pd-l1 on melanoma cells allows tumours to escape anti-ctla4-based therapy, and the combination of radiation, anti-ctla4 and anti-pd-l1 promotes response and immunity through distinct mechanisms."

        "lymph node t cell responses predict the efficacy of live attenuated siv vaccines. live attenuated simian immunodeficiency virus (siv) vaccines (lavs) remain the most efficacious of all vaccines in nonhuman primate models of hiv and aids, yet the basis of their robust protection remains poorly understood. here we show that the degree of lav-mediated protection against intravenous wild-type sivmac239 challenge strongly correlates with the magnitude and function of siv-specific, effector-differentiated t cells in the lymph node but not with the responses of such t cells in the blood or with other cellular, humoral and innate immune parameters. we found that maintenance of protective t cell responses is associated with persistent lav replication in the lymph node, which occurs almost exclusively in follicular helper t cells. thus, effective lavs maintain lymphoid tissue-based, effector-differentiated, siv-specific t cells that intercept and suppress early wild-type siv amplification and, if present in sufficient frequencies, can completely control and perhaps clear infection, an observation that provides a rationale for the development of safe, persistent vectors that can elicit and maintain such responses."

        "modification of kidney barrier function by the urokinase receptor. podocyte dysfunction, represented by foot process effacement and proteinuria, is often the starting point for progressive kidney disease. therapies aimed at the cellular level of the disease are currently not available. here we show that induction of urokinase receptor (upar) signaling in podocytes leads to foot process effacement and urinary protein loss via a mechanism that includes lipid-dependent activation of \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin. mice lacking upar (plaur\u2212/\u2212) are protected from lipopolysaccharide (lps)-mediated proteinuria but develop disease after expression of a constitutively active \u03b23 integrin. gene transfer studies reveal a prerequisite for upar expression in podocytes, but not in endothelial cells, for the development of lps-mediated proteinuria. mechanistically, upar is required to activate \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin in podocytes, promoting cell motility and activation of the small gtpases cdc42 and rac1. blockade of \u03b1v\u03b23 integrin reduces podocyte motility in vitro and lowers proteinuria in mice. our findings show a physiological role for upar signaling in the regulation of kidney permeability."

        "effective use of pi3k and mek inhibitors to treat mutant k-ras g12d and pik3ca h1047r murine lung cancers. somatic mutations that activate phosphoinositide 3-kinase (pi3k) have been identified in the p110-alpha catalytic subunit (encoded by pik3ca). they are most frequently observed in two hotspots: the helical domain (e545k and e542k) and the kinase domain (h1047r). although the p110-alpha mutants are transforming in vitro, their oncogenic potential has not been assessed in genetically engineered mouse models. furthermore, clinical trials with pi3k inhibitors have recently been initiated, and it is unknown if their efficacy will be restricted to specific, genetically defined malignancies. in this study, we engineered a mouse model of lung adenocarcinomas initiated and maintained by expression of p110-alpha h1047r. treatment of these tumors with nvp-bez235, a dual pan-pi3k and mammalian target of rapamycin (mtor) inhibitor in clinical development, led to marked tumor regression as shown by positron emission tomography-computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging and microscopic examination. in contrast, mouse lung cancers driven by mutant kras did not substantially respond to single-agent nvp-bez235. however, when nvp-bez235 was combined with a mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (mek) inhibitor, arry-142886, there was marked synergy in shrinking these kras-mutant cancers. these in vivo studies suggest that inhibitors of the pi3k-mtor pathway may be active in cancers with pik3ca mutations and, when combined with mek inhibitors, may effectively treat kras mutated lung cancers."

        "modelling the impact of artemisinin combination therapy and long-acting treatments on malaria transmission intensity. background artemisinin derivatives used in recently introduced combination therapies (acts) for plasmodium falciparum malaria significantly lower patient infectiousness and have the potential to reduce population-level transmission of the parasite. with the increased interest in malaria elimination, understanding the impact on transmission of act and other antimalarial drugs with different pharmacodynamics becomes a key issue. this study estimates the reduction in transmission that may be achieved by introducing different types of treatment for symptomatic p. falciparum malaria in endemic areas. methods and findings we developed a mathematical model to predict the potential impact on transmission outcomes of introducing act as first-line treatment for uncomplicated malaria in six areas of varying transmission intensity in tanzania. we also estimated the impact that could be achieved by antimalarials with different efficacy, prophylactic time, and gametocytocidal effects. rates of treatment, asymptomatic infection, and symptomatic infection in the six study areas were estimated using the model together with data from a cross-sectional survey of 5,667 individuals conducted prior to policy change from sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine to act. the effects of act and other drug types on gametocytaemia and infectiousness to mosquitoes were independently estimated from clinical trial data. predicted percentage reductions in prevalence of infection and incidence of clinical episodes achieved by act were highest in the areas with low initial transmission. a 53% reduction in prevalence of infection was seen if 100% of current treatment was switched to act in the area where baseline slide-prevalence of parasitaemia was lowest (3.7%), compared to an 11% reduction in the highest-transmission setting (baseline slide prevalence = 57.1%). estimated percentage reductions in incidence of clinical episodes were similar. the absolute size of the public health impact, however, was greater in the highest-transmission area, with 54 clinical episodes per 100 persons per year averted compared to five per 100 persons per year in the lowest-transmission area. high coverage was important. reducing presumptive treatment through improved diagnosis substantially reduced the number of treatment courses required per clinical episode averted in the lower-transmission settings although there was some loss of overall impact on transmission. an efficacious antimalarial regimen with no specific gametocytocidal properties but a long prophylactic time was estimated to be more effective at reducing transmission than a short-acting act in the highest-transmission setting. conclusions our results suggest that acts have the potential for transmission reductions approaching those achieved by insecticide-treated nets in lower-transmission settings. act partner drugs and nonartemisinin regimens with longer prophylactic times could result in a larger impact in higher-transmission settings, although their long term benefit must be evaluated in relation to the risk of development of parasite resistance."

        "structural homeostasis: compensatory adjustments of dendritic arbor geometry in response to variations of synaptic input . as the nervous system develops, there is an inherent variability in the connections formed between differentiating neurons. despite this variability, neural circuits form that are functional and remarkably robust. one way in which neurons deal with variability in their inputs is through compensatory, homeostatic changes in their electrical properties. here, we show that neurons also make compensatory adjustments to their structure. we analysed the development of dendrites on an identified central neuron (acc) in the late drosophila embryo at the stage when it receives its first connections and first becomes electrically active. at the same time, we charted the distribution of presynaptic sites on the developing postsynaptic arbor. genetic manipulations of the presynaptic partners demonstrate that the postsynaptic dendritic arbor adjusts its growth to compensate for changes in the activity and density of synaptic sites. blocking the synthesis or evoked release of presynaptic neurotransmitter results in greater dendritic extension. conversely, an increase in the density of presynaptic release sites induces a reduction in the extent of the dendritic arbor. these growth adjustments occur locally in the arbor and are the result of the promotion or inhibition of growth of neurites in the proximity of presynaptic sites. we provide evidence that suggest a role for the postsynaptic activity state of protein kinase a in mediating this structural adjustment, which modifies dendritic growth in response to synaptic activity. these findings suggest that the dendritic arbor, at least during early stages of connectivity, behaves as a homeostatic device that adjusts its size and geometry to the level and the distribution of input received. the growing arbor thus counterbalances naturally occurring variations in synaptic density and activity so as to ensure that an appropriate level of input is achieved."

        "the development of autoimmune myocarditis in mice by an. background interleukin (il)-12 exerts a potent proinflammatory effect by stimulating t-helper (th) 1 responses. this effect is believed to be mediated primarily through the activation of stat4 and subsequent production of interferon (ifn)-gamma. methods and results- we examined the role of il-12 receptor (il-12r) signaling in the development of murine experimental autoimmune myocarditis (eam) induced by cardiac myosin immunization. both il-12rbeta1-deficient mice and stat4-deficient mice were resistant to the induction of myocarditis. treatment with exogenous il-12 exacerbated disease. we questioned whether ifn-gamma is required for the disease-promoting activity of il-12. on the contrary, we found that ifn-gamma suppresses eam. lack of ifn-gamma due to either depletion with an antibody or a genetic deficiency exacerbated myocarditis. spleens from ifn-gamma-deficient mice immunized with cardiac myosin showed increased cellularity; greater numbers of cd3+, cd4+, cd8+, and il-2-producing cells; and heightened ability to produce cytokines on stimulation in vitro. treatment of mice with recombinant ifn-gamma suppressed the development of myocarditis. conclusions il-12/il-12r/stat4 signaling promotes the development of eam. in contrast, ifn-gamma plays a protective role. the disease-limiting effects of ifn-gamma might be explained by its ability to control the expansion of activated t lymphocytes."

        "a key role for orexin in panic anxiety. panic disorder is a severe anxiety disorder with recurrent, debilitating panic attacks. in individuals with panic disorder there is evidence of decreased central gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) activity as well as marked increases in autonomic and respiratory responses after intravenous infusions of hypertonic sodium lactate. in a rat model of panic disorder, chronic inhibition of gaba synthesis in the dorsomedial-perifornical hypothalamus of rats produces anxiety-like states and a similar vulnerability to sodium lactate-induced cardioexcitatory responses. the dorsomedial-perifornical hypothalamus is enriched in neurons containing orexin (orx, also known as hypocretin), which have a crucial role in arousal, vigilance and central autonomic mobilization, all of which are key components of panic. here we show that activation of orx-synthesizing neurons is necessary for developing a panic-prone state in the rat panic model, and either silencing of the hypothalamic gene encoding orx (hcrt) with rnai or systemic orx-1 receptor antagonists blocks the panic responses. moreover, we show that human subjects with panic anxiety have elevated levels of orx in the cerebrospinal fluid compared to subjects without panic anxiety. taken together, our results suggest that the orx system may be involved in the pathophysiology of panic anxiety and that orx antagonists constitute a potential new treatment strategy for panic disorder."

        "analyzing mechanisms of alternative pre-mrna splicing using in vitro splicing assays.. the development of in vitro assays to analyze pre-mrna splicing resulted in the discovery of many fundamental features characterizing splicing signals and the machinery that completes this process. because in vitro assays can be manipulated by various biochemical approaches, the versatility of investigating alternative pre-mrna splicing in the test tube appears endless. importantly, modifications in reaction conditions can lead to the accumulation, isolation, and characterization of reaction intermediates, a prerequisite for gaining mechanistic insights into how the spliceosome carries out intron removal, and how regulatory elements assist the general splicing machinery in defining splice sites and alternative exons. these considerable experimental advantages have made the in vitro splicing system a standard assay, even though this approach is independent from rna transcription and other rna processing events, and in some respects deviates from the natural process of mrna biogenesis. here, we describe the tools and techniques necessary to carry out in vitro splicing assays. analyses of various experimental designs are presented to highlight the approaches taken to gain insights into the mechanisms by which splice site recognition and activation are communicated with the general splicing machinery. methods to measure the kinetics of splicing, to observe the formation of the pre-spliceosomal complexes, and to manipulate and modify the in vitro system to resolve the regulatory influences in alternative splicing are presented."

        "evidence regarding human papillomavirus testing in secondary prevention of cervical cancer.. more than ever, clinicians need regularly updated reviews given the continuously increasing amount of new information regarding innovative cervical cancer prevention methods. a summary is given from recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews on 3 possible clinical applications of human papillomavirus (hpv) testing: triage of women with equivocal or low-grade cytologic abnormalities; prediction of the therapeutic outcome after treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) lesions, and last not but not least, primary screening for cervical cancer and pre-cancer. consistent evidence is available indicating that hpv-triage with the hybrid capture(\u00ae) 2 assay (qiagen gaithersburg, inc., md, usa [previously digene corp.] (hc2) is more accurate (higher sensitivity, similar specificity) than repeat cytology to triage women with equivocal pap smear results. several other tests show at least similar accuracy but mrna testing with the aptima(\u00ae) (gen-probe inc., san diego, ca, usa) test is similarly sensitive but more specific compared to hc2. in triage of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (lsil), hc2 is more sensitive but its specificity is substantially lower compared to repeat cytology. the aptima(\u00ae) test is more specific than hc2 without showing a loss in sensitivity. identification of dna of hpv types 16 and/or 18, or rna from the five most carcinogenic hpv types allow selecting women at highest risk for cin3+ but the sensitivity and negative predictive value of these markers are lower than full-range high-risk hpv (hrhpv) testing. after conservative treatment of cervical pre-cancer, hpv testing picks up more quickly, with higher sensitivity and not lower specificity, residual or recurrent high-grade cin than follow-up cytology. primary screening for hrhpv generally detects more cin2, cin3 or cancer compared to cytology at cut-off atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (asc-us) or lsil, but is less specific. combined hpv and cytology screening provides a further small gain in sensitivity at the expense of a considerable loss in specificity if positive by either test is referred to colposcopy, in comparison with hpv testing only. randomised trials and follow-up of cohort studies consistently demonstrate a significantly lower cumulative incidence of cin3+ and even of cancer, in women aged 30 years or older, who were at enrollment hrhpv dna negative compared to those who were cytologically negative. the difference in cumulative risk of cin3+ or cancer for double negative (cytology & hpv) versus only hpv-negative women is small. hc2, gp5+/6+ pcr (polymerase chain reaction), cobas(\u00ae) 4800 pcr (roche molecular systems inc., alameda, ca, usa) and real time pcr (abbott molecular, des plaines, il, usa) can be considered as clinically validated for use in primary screening. the loss in specificity associated with primary hpv-based screening can be compensated by appropriate algorithms involving reflex cytology and/or hpv genotyping for hpv16 or 18. there exists a substantial evidence base to support that hpv testing is advantageous both in triage of women with equivocal abnormal cytology, in surveillance after treatment of cin lesions and in primary screening of women aged 30 years or older. however, the possible advantages offered by hpv-based screening require a well organised program with good compliance with screening and triage policies. this article forms part of a special supplement entitled \"comprehensive control of hpv infections and related diseases\" vaccine volume 30, supplement 5, 2012."

        "evidence regarding human papillomavirus testing in secondary prevention of cervical cancer.. more than ever, clinicians need regularly updated reviews given the continuously increasing amount of new information regarding innovative cervical cancer prevention methods. a summary is given from recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews on 3 possible clinical applications of human papillomavirus (hpv) testing: triage of women with equivocal or low-grade cytologic abnormalities; prediction of the therapeutic outcome after treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) lesions, and last not but not least, primary screening for cervical cancer and pre-cancer. consistent evidence is available indicating that hpv-triage with the hybrid capture(\u00ae) 2 assay (qiagen gaithersburg, inc., md, usa [previously digene corp.] (hc2) is more accurate (higher sensitivity, similar specificity) than repeat cytology to triage women with equivocal pap smear results. several other tests show at least similar accuracy but mrna testing with the aptima(\u00ae) (gen-probe inc., san diego, ca, usa) test is similarly sensitive but more specific compared to hc2. in triage of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (lsil), hc2 is more sensitive but its specificity is substantially lower compared to repeat cytology. the aptima(\u00ae) test is more specific than hc2 without showing a loss in sensitivity. identification of dna of hpv types 16 and/or 18, or rna from the five most carcinogenic hpv types allow selecting women at highest risk for cin3+ but the sensitivity and negative predictive value of these markers are lower than full-range high-risk hpv (hrhpv) testing. after conservative treatment of cervical pre-cancer, hpv testing picks up more quickly, with higher sensitivity and not lower specificity, residual or recurrent high-grade cin than follow-up cytology. primary screening for hrhpv generally detects more cin2, cin3 or cancer compared to cytology at cut-off atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (asc-us) or lsil, but is less specific. combined hpv and cytology screening provides a further small gain in sensitivity at the expense of a considerable loss in specificity if positive by either test is referred to colposcopy, in comparison with hpv testing only. randomised trials and follow-up of cohort studies consistently demonstrate a significantly lower cumulative incidence of cin3+ and even of cancer, in women aged 30 years or older, who were at enrollment hrhpv dna negative compared to those who were cytologically negative. the difference in cumulative risk of cin3+ or cancer for double negative (cytology & hpv) versus only hpv-negative women is small. hc2, gp5+/6+ pcr (polymerase chain reaction), cobas(\u00ae) 4800 pcr (roche molecular systems inc., alameda, ca, usa) and real time pcr (abbott molecular, des plaines, il, usa) can be considered as clinically validated for use in primary screening. the loss in specificity associated with primary hpv-based screening can be compensated by appropriate algorithms involving reflex cytology and/or hpv genotyping for hpv16 or 18. there exists a substantial evidence base to support that hpv testing is advantageous both in triage of women with equivocal abnormal cytology, in surveillance after treatment of cin lesions and in primary screening of women aged 30 years or older. however, the possible advantages offered by hpv-based screening require a well organised program with good compliance with screening and triage policies. this article forms part of a special supplement entitled \"comprehensive control of hpv infections and related diseases\" vaccine volume 30, supplement 5, 2012."

        "h3k9 demethylase kdm4e is an epigenetic regulator for bovine embryonic development and a defective factor for nuclear reprogramming.. aberrant epigenetic reprogramming often results in developmental defects in somatic cell nuclear transfer (scnt) embryos during embryonic genome activation (ega). bovine eight-cell scnt embryos exhibit global hypermethylation of histone h3 lysine 9 tri- and di-methylation (h3k9me3/2), but the intrinsic reason for this remains elusive. here, we provide evidence that two h3k9 demethylase genes, lysine-specific demethylase 4d (kdm4d) and 4e (kdm4e), are related to active h3k9me3/2 demethylation in in vitro fertilized (ivf) embryos and are deficiently expressed in cloned embryos at the time of ega. moreover, kdm4e plays a more crucial role in ivf and scnt embryonic development, and overexpression of kdm4e can restore the global transcriptome, improve blastocyst formation and increase the cloning efficiency of scnt embryos. our results thereby indicate that kdm4e can function as a crucial epigenetic regulator of ega and as an internal defective factor responsible for persistent h3k9me3/2 barriers to scnt-mediated reprogramming. furthermore, we show that interactions between rna and kdm4e are essential for h3k9 demethylation during ega. these observations advance the understanding of incomplete nuclear reprogramming and are of great importance for transgenic cattle procreation."

        "spatial and temporal clustering of dengue virus transmission in thai villages. background transmission of dengue viruses (denv), the leading cause of arboviral disease worldwide, is known to vary through time and space, likely owing to a combination of factors related to the human host, virus, mosquito vector, and environment. an improved understanding of variation in transmission patterns is fundamental to conducting surveillance and implementing disease prevention strategies. to test the hypothesis that denv transmission is spatially and temporally focal, we compared geographic and temporal characteristics within thai villages where denv are and are not being actively transmitted. methods and findings cluster investigations were conducted within 100 m of homes where febrile index children with (positive clusters) and without (negative clusters) acute dengue lived during two seasons of peak denv transmission. data on human infection and mosquito infection/density were examined to precisely (1) define the spatial and temporal dimensions of denv transmission, (2) correlate these factors with variation in denv transmission, and (3) determine the burden of inapparent and symptomatic infections. among 556 village children enrolled as neighbors of 12 dengue-positive and 22 dengue-negative index cases, all 27 denv infections (4.9% of enrollees) occurred in positive clusters (p < 0.01; attributable risk [ar] = 10.4 per 100; 95% confidence interval 1-19.8 per 100]. in positive clusters, 12.4% of enrollees became infected in a 15-d period and denv infections were aggregated centrally near homes of index cases. as only 1 of 217 pairs of serologic specimens tested in positive clusters revealed a recent denv infection that occurred prior to cluster initiation, we attribute the observed denv transmission subsequent to cluster investigation to recent denv transmission activity. of the 1,022 female adult ae. aegypti collected, all eight (0.8%) dengue-infected mosquitoes came from houses in positive clusters; none from control clusters or schools. distinguishing features between positive and negative clusters were greater availability of piped water in negative clusters (p < 0.01) and greater number of ae. aegypti pupae per person in positive clusters (p = 0.04). during primarily denv-4 transmission seasons, the ratio of inapparent to symptomatic infections was nearly 1:1 among child enrollees. study limitations included inability to sample all children and mosquitoes within each cluster and our reliance on serologic rather than virologic evidence of interval infections in enrollees given restrictions on the frequency of blood collections in children. conclusions our data reveal the remarkably focal nature of denv transmission within a hyperendemic rural area of thailand. these data suggest that active school-based dengue case detection prompting local spraying could contain recent virus introductions and reduce the longitudinal risk of virus spread within rural areas. our results should prompt future cluster studies to explore how host immune and behavioral aspects may impact denv transmission and prevention strategies. cluster methodology could serve as a useful research tool for investigation of other temporally and spatially clustered infectious diseases."

        "enhancer evolution across 20 mammalian species. the mammalian radiation has corresponded with rapid changes in noncoding regions of the genome, but we lack a comprehensive understanding of regulatory evolution in mammals. here, we track the evolution of promoters and enhancers active in liver across 20 mammalian species from six diverse orders by profiling genomic enrichment of h3k27 acetylation and h3k4 trimethylation. we report that rapid evolution of enhancers is a universal feature of mammalian genomes. most of the recently evolved enhancers arise from ancestral dna exaptation, rather than lineage-specific expansions of repeat elements. in contrast, almost all liver promoters are partially or fully conserved across these species. our data further reveal that recently evolved enhancers can be associated with genes under positive selection, demonstrating the power of this approach for annotating regulatory adaptations in genomic sequences. these results provide important insight into the functional genetics underpinning mammalian regulatory evolution."

        "sympathetic neural mechanisms in normal and hypertensive pregnancy in humans.. background direct recordings from peripheral sympathetic nerves have shown an increased sympathetic drive in pregnancy-induced hypertension (pih) and preeclampsia (pe). it is unknown whether sympathetic drive is altered in normal pregnancy, when arterial blood pressure can be normal or relatively low. the aim of this study was to measure and compare peripheral sympathetic discharge, its vasoconstrictor effect and its baroreceptor control, during pregnancy and postpartum in women with normal pregnancy (np) and pih and in normotensive nonpregnant (nn) women. methods and results twenty-one women with np, 18 women with pih, and 21 nn women had muscle sympathetic nerve activity assessed from multiunit discharges (msna) and from single units with defined vasoconstrictor properties (s-msna). the s-msna in np (38+/-6.6 impulses/100 beats) was greater (p<0.05) than in nn women (19+/-1.8 impulses/100 beats) despite similar age and body weight but less than in pih women (p<0.001) (146+/-23.5 impulses/100 beats). msna followed a similar trend. cardiac baroreceptor reflex sensitivity (brs) was impaired in np and pih women relative to nn. after delivery, sympathetic activity decreased to values similar to those obtained in nn, and there was an increase in brs. in women with np, the decrease in sympathetic output occurred despite an insignificant change in blood pressure. conclusions central sympathetic output was increased in women with normal pregnancy and was even greater in the hypertensive pregnant group. the findings suggest that the moderate sympathetic hyperactivity during the latter months of normal pregnancy may help to return the arterial pressure to nonpregnant levels, although when the increase in activity is excessive, hypertension may ensue."

        "microarrays for the study of viral gene expression during human cytomegalovirus latent infection.. human cytomegalovirus (hcmv) is one of the largest known dna viruses. it is ubiquitous, and following resolution of primary productive infection, it persists in the human host by establishing a lifelong latent infection in myeloid lineage cells such as monocytes and their progenitors. most adults with hcmv infection are healthy but it can cause neurologic deficits in infants, and remains an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunosuppressed patient. microarray-based studies of hcmv have provided useful information about genes that are transcriptionally active during both productive and latent phases of infection. this chapter describes how to study genes in hcmv using microarrays and two cell types (productively infected human foreskin fibroblasts, and latently infected primary human myeloid progenitor cells)."

        "transcriptome analysis reveals human cytomegalovirus reprograms monocyte differentiation toward an m1 macrophage.. monocytes are primary targets for human cmv (hcmv) infection and are proposed to be responsible for hematogenous dissemination of the virus. monocytes acquire different functional traits during polarization to the classical proinflammatory m1 macrophage or the alternative antiinflammatory m2 macrophage. we hypothesized that hcmv induced a proinflammatory m1 macrophage following infection to promote viral dissemination because, biologically, a proinflammatory state provides the tools to drive infected monocytes from the blood into the tissue. to test this hypothesis of monocyte conversion from a normal quiescent phenotype to an inflammatory phenotype, we used affymetrix microarray to acquire a transcriptional profile of infected monocytes at a time point our data emphasized is a key temporal regulatory point following infection. we found that hcmv significantly up-regulated 583 (5.2%) of the total genes and down-regulated 621 (5.5%) of the total genes>or=1.5-fold at 4 h postinfection. further ontology analysis revealed that genes implicated in classical m1 macrophage activation were stimulated by hcmv infection. we found that 65% of genes strictly associated with m1 polarization were up-regulated, while only 4% of genes solely associated with m2 polarization were up-regulated. analysis of the monocyte chemokinome at the transcriptional level showed that 44% of m1 and 33% of m2 macrophage chemokines were up-regulated. proteomic analysis using chemokine ab arrays confirmed the secretion of these chemotactic proteins from hcmv-infected monocytes. overall, the results identify that the hcmv-infected monocyte transcriptome displayed a unique m1/m2 polarization signature that was skewed toward the classical m1 activation phenotype."

        "the global spread of hepatitis c virus 1a and 1b: a phylodynamic and phylogeographic analysis. background hepatitis c virus (hcv) is estimated to affect 130-180 million people worldwide. although its origin is unknown, patterns of viral diversity suggest that hcv genotype 1 probably originated from west africa. previous attempts to estimate the spatiotemporal parameters of the virus, both globally and regionally, have suggested that epidemic hcv transmission began in 1900 and grew steadily until the late 1980s. however, epidemiological data suggest that the expansion of hcv may have occurred after the second world war. the aim of our study was to elucidate the timescale and route of the global spread of hcv. methods and findings we show that the rarely sequenced hcv region (e2p7ns2) is more informative for molecular epidemiology studies than the more commonly used ns5b region. we applied phylodynamic methods to a substantial set of new e2p7ns2 and ns5b sequences, together with all available global hcv sequences with information in both of these genomic regions, in order to estimate the timescale and nature of the global expansion of the most prevalent hcv subtypes, 1a and 1b. we showed that transmission of subtypes 1a and 1b \"exploded\" between 1940 and 1980, with the spread of 1b preceding that of 1a by at least 16 y (95% confidence interval 15-17). phylogeographic analysis of all available ns5b sequences suggests that hcv subtypes 1a and 1b disseminated from the developed world to the developing countries. conclusions the evolutionary rate of hcv appears faster than previously suggested. the global spread of hcv coincided with the widespread use of transfused blood and blood products and with the expansion of intravenous drug use but slowed prior to the wide implementation of anti-hcv screening. differences in the transmission routes associated with subtypes 1a and 1b provide an explanation of the relatively earlier expansion of 1b. our data show that the most plausible route of the hcv dispersal was from developed countries to the developing world. please see later in the article for the editors' summary."

        "a view to a kill: the bacterial type vi secretion system.. the bacterial type vi secretion system (t6ss) is an organelle that is structurally and mechanistically analogous to an intracellular membrane-attached contractile phage tail. recent studies determined that a rapid conformational change in the structure of a sheath protein complex propels t6ss spike and tube components along with antibacterial and antieukaryotic effectors out of predatory t6ss(+) cells and into prey cells. the contracted organelle is then recycled in an atp-dependent process. t6ss is regulated at transcriptional and posttranslational levels, the latter involving detection of membrane perturbation in some species. in addition to directly targeting eukaryotic cells, the t6ss can also target other bacteria coinfecting a mammalian host, highlighting the importance of the t6ss not only for bacterial survival in environmental ecosystems, but also in the context of infection and disease. this review highlights these and other advances in our understanding of the structure, mechanical function, assembly, and regulation of the t6ss."

        "inflammatory signaling in human tuberculosis granulomas is spatially organized. granulomas are the pathological hallmark of tuberculosis (tb). however, their function and mechanisms of formation remain poorly understood. to understand the role of granulomas in tb, we analyzed the proteomes of granulomas from subjects with tuberculosis in an unbiased manner. using laser-capture microdissection, mass spectrometry and confocal microscopy, we generated detailed molecular maps of human granulomas. we found that the centers of granulomas have a pro-inflammatory environment that is characterized by the presence of antimicrobial peptides, reactive oxygen species and pro-inflammatory eicosanoids. conversely, the tissue surrounding the caseum has a comparatively anti-inflammatory signature. these findings are consistent across a set of six human subjects and in rabbits. although the balance between systemic pro- and anti-inflammatory signals is crucial to tb disease outcome, here we find that these signals are physically segregated within each granuloma. from the protein and lipid snapshots of human and rabbit lesions analyzed here, we hypothesize that the pathologic response to tb is shaped by the precise anatomical localization of these inflammatory pathways during the development of the granuloma."

        "induction of myelodysplasia by myeloid-derived suppressor cells.. myelodysplastic syndromes (mds) are age-dependent stem cell malignancies that share biological features of activated adaptive immune response and ineffective hematopoiesis. here we report that myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mdsc), which are classically linked to immunosuppression, inflammation, and cancer, were markedly expanded in the bone marrow of mds patients and played a pathogenetic role in the development of ineffective hematopoiesis. these clonally distinct mdsc overproduce hematopoietic suppressive cytokines and function as potent apoptotic effectors targeting autologous hematopoietic progenitors. using multiple transfected cell models, we found that mdsc expansion is driven by the interaction of the proinflammatory molecule s100a9 with cd33. these 2 proteins formed a functional ligand/receptor pair that recruited components to cd33\u2019s immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (itim), inducing secretion of the suppressive cytokines il-10 and tgf-\u03b2 by immature myeloid cells. s100a9 transgenic mice displayed bone marrow accumulation of mdsc accompanied by development of progressive multilineage cytopenias and cytological dysplasia. importantly, early forced maturation of mdsc by either all-trans-retinoic acid treatment or active immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif\u2013bearing (itam-bearing) adapter protein (dap12) interruption of cd33 signaling rescued the hematologic phenotype. these findings indicate that primary bone marrow expansion of mdsc driven by the s100a9/cd33 pathway perturbs hematopoiesis and contributes to the development of mds."

        "type 1 diabetes-associated il2ra variation lowers il-2 signaling and contributes to diminished cd4+cd25+ regulatory t cell function.. numerous reports have demonstrated that cd4(+)cd25(+) regulatory t cells (tregs) from individuals with a range of human autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, are deficient in their ability to control autologous proinflammatory responses when compared with nondiseased, control individuals. treg dysfunction could be a primary, causal event or may result from perturbations in the immune system during disease development. polymorphisms in genes associated with treg function, such as il2ra, confer a higher risk of autoimmune disease. although this suggests a primary role for defective tregs in autoimmunity, a link between il2ra gene polymorphisms and treg function has not been examined. we addressed this by examining the impact of an il2ra haplotype associated with type 1 diabetes on treg fitness and suppressive function. studies were conducted using healthy human subjects to avoid any confounding effects of disease. we demonstrated that the presence of an autoimmune disease-associated il2ra haplotype correlates with diminished il-2 responsiveness in ag-experienced cd4(+) t cells, as measured by phosphorylation of stat5a, and is associated with lower levels of foxp3 expression by tregs and a reduction in their ability to suppress proliferation of autologous effector t cells. these data offer a rationale that contributes to the molecular and cellular mechanisms through which polymorphisms in the il-2ra gene affect immune regulation, and consequently upon susceptibility to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases."

        "targeting a20 decreases glioma stem cell survival and tumor growth. glioblastomas are deadly cancers that display a functional cellular hierarchy maintained by self-renewing glioblastoma stem cells (gscs). gscs are regulated by molecular pathways distinct from the bulk tumor that may be useful therapeutic targets. we determined that a20 (tnfaip3), a regulator of cell survival and the nf-kappab pathway, is overexpressed in gscs relative to non-stem glioblastoma cells at both the mrna and protein levels. to determine the functional significance of a20 in gscs, we targeted a20 expression with lentiviral-mediated delivery of short hairpin rna (shrna). inhibiting a20 expression decreased gsc growth and survival through mechanisms associated with decreased cell-cycle progression and decreased phosphorylation of p65/rela. elevated levels of a20 in gscs contributed to apoptotic resistance: gscs were less susceptible to tnfalpha-induced cell death than matched non-stem glioma cells, but a20 knockdown sensitized gscs to tnfalpha-mediated apoptosis. the decreased survival of gscs upon a20 knockdown contributed to the reduced ability of these cells to self-renew in primary and secondary neurosphere formation assays. the tumorigenic potential of gscs was decreased with a20 targeting, resulting in increased survival of mice bearing human glioma xenografts. in silico analysis of a glioma patient genomic database indicates that a20 overexpression and amplification is inversely correlated with survival. together these data indicate that a20 contributes to glioma maintenance through effects on the glioma stem cell subpopulation. although inactivating mutations in a20 in lymphoma suggest a20 can act as a tumor suppressor, similar point mutations have not been identified through glioma genomic sequencing: in fact, our data suggest a20 may function as a tumor enhancer in glioma through promotion of gsc survival. a20 anticancer therapies should therefore be viewed with caution as effects will likely differ depending on the tumor type."

        "scaffold-based three-dimensional human fibroblast culture provides a structural matrix that supports angiogenesis in infarcted heart tissue.. background we have developed techniques to implant angiogenic patches onto the epicardium over regions of infarcted cardiac tissue to stimulate revascularization of the damaged tissue. these experiments used a scaffold-based 3d human dermal fibroblast culture (3dfc) as an epicardial patch. the 3dfc contains viable cells that secrete angiogenic growth factors and has previously been shown to stimulate angiogenic activity. the hypothesis tested was that a viable 3dfc cardiac patch would stimulate an angiogenic response within an area of infarcted cardiac tissue. methods and results a coronary occlusion of a branch of the left anterior descending coronary artery was performed by thermal ligation in severe combined immunodeficient mice. 3dfcs with or without viable cells were sized to the damaged area, implanted in replicate mice onto the epicardium at the site of tissue injury, and compared with animals that received infarct surgery but no implant. fourteen and 30 days after surgery, hearts were exposed and photographed, and tissue samples were prepared for histology and cytochemistry. fourteen and 30 days after surgery, the damaged myocardium receiving viable 3dfc exhibited a significantly greater angiogenic response (including arterioles, venules, and capillaries) than nonviable and untreated control groups. conclusions in this animal model, viable 3dfc stimulates angiogenesis within a region of cardiac infarction and can augment a repair response in damaged tissue. therefore, a potential use for 3dfc is the repair of myocardial tissue damaged by infarction."

        "open access increases citation rate. plos biology publishes today a research article by gunther eysenbach that is not about biology. it is about citations. it provides robust evidence that open-access articles (oa articles) are more immediately recognized and cited than non-oa articles. as such, it adds objective support to the belief we have always held that open-access publication speeds up scientific dialog between researchers and, consequently, should be extended to the whole scientific literature as quickly as possible. it is therefore fitting that we publish such a paper. we have long argued that papers freely available in a journal will be more often read and cited than those behind a subscription barrier. however, solid evidence to support or refute such a claim has been surprisingly hard to find. since most open-access journals are new, comparisons of the effects of open access with established subscription-based journals are easily confounded by age and reputation. in the current study, eysenbach compared citations compiled by thomson scientific (formerly thomson isi) to individual articles published between june 2004 and december 2004 in the same journal\u2014namely, proceedings of the national academy of sciences (pnas), which announced its open-access option for authors on june 8 of that year, with an associated publication charge of us$1,000. non-oa articles in pnas are subject to a six-month \u201ctoll-access\u201d delay before the article becomes publicly available. the results of this natural experiment are clear: in the 4 to 16 months following publication, oa articles gained a significant citation advantage over non-oa articles during the same period. they are twice as likely to be cited 4 to 10 months after publication and almost three times as likely between 10 and 16 months. given that pnas delays open access for only six months, the disparity between oa and non-oa articles in journals where the delay is longer or where articles remain \u201ctoll-access\u201d is likely to be even greater. eysenbach also looked at the impact of self-archiving non-oa articles. one route to open access, it is argued, is for authors to archive their published articles on their own web sites or in institutional repositories, although this does not include an explicit business model to cover the cost of peer-review and publishing. the analysis revealed that self-archived articles are also cited less often than oa articles from the same journal. yes, you're right; we do have a strong and vested interest in publishing results that so obviously endorse our existence. moreover, the author of the article is also an editor of an open-access journal. but sometimes a potential conflict of interest can actually help to ensure rigor. in this case, we have an acute interest in ensuring that the article meets the same, if not higher, standards as any other research article we publish. not only must the conclusions provide a significant advance for the field, but the study must be technically sound, with appropriate evidence to support those conclusions. as with all our research articles, we consulted throughout the evaluation process with an academic editor with appropriate expertise\u2014in this case, carol tenopir, professor of information sciences at the university of tennessee (knoxville, tennessee, united states). the article was reviewed by two experts in bibliometric analyses and information science, and an experienced research biologist with expertise in statistics. they all enthusiastically supported publication, although one understandably questioned the suitability of plos biology as the publication venue. we have no intention of making plos biology a regular home for bibliometric studies (even when about open access). what makes this study worth publishing in plos biology is not only the relative strength of evidence supporting the claim but also the extent to which many (especially other publishers) have anticipated such an analysis. as far as we are aware, no other study has compared oa and non-oa articles from the same journal and controlled for so many potentially confounding factors. eysenbach's multivariate analysis took into account the number of days since publication, number of authors, article type, country of the corresponding author, funding type, subject area, submission track ( pnas has three different ways that authors can submit a paper), and the previous citation record of the first and last authors. he even administered a supplementary questionnaire to assess whether authors choosing the oa option in pnas chose to do so for only their most important research (they didn't). as ian rowlands from the centre for publishing at university college london\u2014and one of the reviewers who agreed to be identified in this article\u2014said at the start of his review:          \u201cmany (most) of the papers and presentations i have read/seen on this topic have completely failed to address the kinds of confounding issues that are so convincingly tackled here. for that reason alone, this paper deserves to be published and alerted to the widest possible audience. \u201d          in addition to providing evidence for the immediate advantage of open access, eysenbach's analysis also highlights several potential challenges to its long-term future. although a limited dataset, the citation history of the first and last authors differed between those who chose the open-access option and those who did not. in the group that chose open access, last authors tended to have a \u201cstronger\u201d previous citation record, whereas this situation was reversed among the group that declined the open-access option\u2014here, it was the first authors who tended to be stronger. this may reflect varying attitudes of authors at different stages of their career, a stronger influence from the leader of a particular group, or an age- or career-related difference in the ability to pay the publication charge (e.g., [ 1]). indeed, access to appropriate funds may also be a reason why a lower proportion of authors from european countries tended to choose the open-access option. in many of these countries, funds for page charges\u2014and, by extension, open-access publication fees\u2014are often not included within research grants. pnas was one of the first journals to offer an open-access option to its authors. however, such hybrid journals are increasing: blackwell, springer, and oxford university press now provide this option as well. this means that similar experiments can be replicated. moreover, although the evidence from the current analysis argues most strongly for a time advantage in citation for oa articles, a study over longer periods will reveal whether this translates into a sustained increase in the number of citations. in the meantime, open-access advocates should be emboldened by tangible evidence for what has seemed obvious all along."

        "chemotherapy options in elderly and frail patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mrc focus2): an open-label, randomised factorial trial. background elderly and frail patients with cancer, although often treated with chemotherapy, are under-represented in clinical trials. we designed focus2 to investigate reduced-dose chemotherapy options and to seek objective predictors of outcome in frail patients with advanced colorectal cancer. methods we undertook an open, 2 \u00d7 2 factorial trial in 61 uk centres for patients with previously untreated advanced colorectal cancer who were considered unfit for full-dose chemotherapy. after comprehensive health assessment (cha), patients were randomly assigned by minimisation to: 48-h intravenous fluorouracil with levofolinate (group a); oxaliplatin and fluorouracil (group b); capecitabine (group c); or oxaliplatin and capecitabine (group d). treatment allocation was not masked. starting doses were 80% of standard doses, with discretionary escalation to full dose after 6 weeks. the two primary outcome measures were: addition of oxaliplatin ([a vs b] + [c vs d]), assessed with progression-free survival (pfs); and substitution of fluorouracil with capecitabine ([a vs c] + [b vs d]), assessed by change from baseline to 12 weeks in global quality of life (qol). analysis was by intention to treat. baseline clinical and cha data were modelled against outcomes with a novel composite measure, overall treatment utility (otu). this study is registered, number isrctn21221452. findings 459 patients were randomly assigned (115 to each of groups a-c, 114 to group d). factorial comparison of addition of oxaliplatin versus no addition suggested some improvement in pfs, but the finding was not significant (median 5\u00b78 months [iqr 3\u00b73-7\u00b75] vs 4\u00b75 months [2\u00b78-6\u00b74]; hazard ratio 0\u00b784, 95% ci 0\u00b769-1\u00b701, p=0\u00b707). replacement of fluorouracil with capecitabine did not improve global qol: 69 of 124 (56%) patients receiving fluorouracil reported improvement in global qol compared with 69 of 123 (56%) receiving capecitabine. the risk of having any grade 3 or worse toxic effect was not significantly increased with oxaliplatin (83/219 [38%] vs 70/221 [32%]; p=0\u00b717), but was higher with capecitabine than with fluorouracil (88/222 [40%] vs 65/218 [30%]; p=0\u00b703). in multivariable analysis, fewer baseline symptoms (odds ratio 1\u00b732, 95% ci 1\u00b714-1\u00b752), less widespread disease (1\u00b751, 1\u00b705-2\u00b719), and use of oxaliplatin (0\u00b757, 0\u00b739-0\u00b782) were predictive of better otu. interpretation focus2 shows that with an appropriate design, including reduced starting doses of chemotherapy, frail and elderly patients can participate in a randomised controlled trial. on balance, a combination including oxaliplatin was preferable to single-agent fluoropyrimidines, although the primary endpoint of pfs was not met. capecitabine did not improve qol compared with fluorouracil. comprehensive baseline assessment holds promise as an objective predictor of treatment benefit. funding cancer research uk and the medical research council."

        "altered recognition of antigen is a mechanism of cd8+ t cell tolerance in cancer. antigen-specific cd8+ t-cell tolerance, induced by myeloid-derived suppressor cells (mdscs), is one of the main mechanisms of tumor escape. using in vivo models, we show here that mdscs directly disrupt the binding of specific peptide\u2013major histocompatibility complex (pmhc) dimers to cd8-expressing t cells through nitration of tyrosines in a t-cell receptor (tcr)-cd8 complex. this process makes cd8-expressing t cells unable to bind pmhc and to respond to the specific peptide, although they retain their ability to respond to nonspecific stimulation. nitration of tcr-cd8 is induced by mdscs through hyperproduction of reactive oxygen species and peroxynitrite during direct cell-cell contact. molecular modeling suggests specific sites of nitration that might affect the conformational flexibility of tcr-cd8 and its interaction with pmhc. these data identify a previously unknown mechanism of t-cell tolerance in cancer that is also pertinent to many pathological conditions associated with accumulation of mdscs."

        "presynaptically localized cyclic gmp-dependent protein kinase 1 is a key determinant of spinal synaptic potentiation and pain hypersensitivity. synaptic long-term potentiation (ltp) at spinal neurons directly communicating pain-specific inputs from the periphery to the brain has been proposed to serve as a trigger for pain hypersensitivity in pathological states. previous studies have functionally implicated the nmda receptor-no pathway and the downstream second messenger, cgmp, in these processes. because cgmp can broadly influence diverse ion-channels, kinases, and phosphodiesterases, pre- as well as post-synaptically, the precise identity of cgmp targets mediating spinal ltp, their mechanisms of action, and their locus in the spinal circuitry are still unclear. here, we found that protein kinase g1 (pkg-i) localized presynaptically in nociceptor terminals plays an essential role in the expression of spinal ltp. using the cre-lox p system, we generated nociceptor-specific knockout mice lacking pkg-i specifically in presynaptic terminals of nociceptors in the spinal cord, but not in post-synaptic neurons or elsewhere (sns-pkg-i(-/-) mice). patch clamp recordings showed that activity-induced ltp at identified synapses between nociceptors and spinal neurons projecting to the periaqueductal grey (pag) was completely abolished in sns-pkg-i(-/-) mice, although basal synaptic transmission was not affected. analyses of synaptic failure rates and paired-pulse ratios indicated a role for presynaptic pkg-i in regulating the probability of neurotransmitter release. inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptor 1 and myosin light chain kinase were recruited as key phosphorylation targets of presynaptic pkg-i in nociceptive neurons. finally, behavioural analyses in vivo showed marked defects in sns-pkg-i(-/-) mice in several models of activity-induced nociceptive hypersensitivity, and pharmacological studies identified a clear contribution of pkg-i expressed in spinal terminals of nociceptors. our results thus indicate that presynaptic mechanisms involving an increase in release probability from nociceptors are operational in the expression of synaptic ltp on spinal-pag projection neurons and that pkg-i localized in presynaptic nociceptor terminals plays an essential role in this process to regulate pain sensitivity."

        "evidence regarding human papillomavirus testing in secondary prevention of cervical cancer.. more than ever, clinicians need regularly updated reviews given the continuously increasing amount of new information regarding innovative cervical cancer prevention methods. a summary is given from recent meta-analyses and systematic reviews on 3 possible clinical applications of human papillomavirus (hpv) testing: triage of women with equivocal or low-grade cytologic abnormalities; prediction of the therapeutic outcome after treatment of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) lesions, and last not but not least, primary screening for cervical cancer and pre-cancer. consistent evidence is available indicating that hpv-triage with the hybrid capture(\u00ae) 2 assay (qiagen gaithersburg, inc., md, usa [previously digene corp.] (hc2) is more accurate (higher sensitivity, similar specificity) than repeat cytology to triage women with equivocal pap smear results. several other tests show at least similar accuracy but mrna testing with the aptima(\u00ae) (gen-probe inc., san diego, ca, usa) test is similarly sensitive but more specific compared to hc2. in triage of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (lsil), hc2 is more sensitive but its specificity is substantially lower compared to repeat cytology. the aptima(\u00ae) test is more specific than hc2 without showing a loss in sensitivity. identification of dna of hpv types 16 and/or 18, or rna from the five most carcinogenic hpv types allow selecting women at highest risk for cin3+ but the sensitivity and negative predictive value of these markers are lower than full-range high-risk hpv (hrhpv) testing. after conservative treatment of cervical pre-cancer, hpv testing picks up more quickly, with higher sensitivity and not lower specificity, residual or recurrent high-grade cin than follow-up cytology. primary screening for hrhpv generally detects more cin2, cin3 or cancer compared to cytology at cut-off atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (asc-us) or lsil, but is less specific. combined hpv and cytology screening provides a further small gain in sensitivity at the expense of a considerable loss in specificity if positive by either test is referred to colposcopy, in comparison with hpv testing only. randomised trials and follow-up of cohort studies consistently demonstrate a significantly lower cumulative incidence of cin3+ and even of cancer, in women aged 30 years or older, who were at enrollment hrhpv dna negative compared to those who were cytologically negative. the difference in cumulative risk of cin3+ or cancer for double negative (cytology & hpv) versus only hpv-negative women is small. hc2, gp5+/6+ pcr (polymerase chain reaction), cobas(\u00ae) 4800 pcr (roche molecular systems inc., alameda, ca, usa) and real time pcr (abbott molecular, des plaines, il, usa) can be considered as clinically validated for use in primary screening. the loss in specificity associated with primary hpv-based screening can be compensated by appropriate algorithms involving reflex cytology and/or hpv genotyping for hpv16 or 18. there exists a substantial evidence base to support that hpv testing is advantageous both in triage of women with equivocal abnormal cytology, in surveillance after treatment of cin lesions and in primary screening of women aged 30 years or older. however, the possible advantages offered by hpv-based screening require a well organised program with good compliance with screening and triage policies. this article forms part of a special supplement entitled \"comprehensive control of hpv infections and related diseases\" vaccine volume 30, supplement 5, 2012."

        "human papillomavirus testing for the detection of high-grade cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer: final results of the pobascam randomised controlled trial.. background human papillomavirus (hpv) testing is more sensitive for the detection of high-grade cervical lesions than is cytology, but detection of hpv by dna screening in two screening rounds 5 years apart has not been assessed. the aim of this study was to assess whether hpv dna testing in the first screen decreases detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (cin) grade 3 or worse, cin grade 2 or worse, and cervical cancer in the second screening. methods in this randomised trial, women aged 29-56 years participating in the cervical screening programme in the netherlands were randomly assigned to receive hpv dna (gp5+/6+-pcr method) and cytology co-testing or cytology testing alone, from january, 1999, to september, 2002. randomisation (in a 1:1 ratio) was done with computer-generated random numbers after the cervical specimen had been taken. at the second screening 5 years later, hpv dna and cytology co-testing was done in both groups; researchers were masked to the patient's assignment. the primary endpoint was the number of cin grade 3 or worse detected. analysis was done by intention to screen. the trial is now finished and is registered, number isrctn20781131. findings 22,420 women were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 22 518 to the control group; 19 999 in the intervention group and 20,106 in the control group were eligible for analysis at the first screen. at the second screen, 19 579 women in the intervention group and 19,731 in the control group were eligible, of whom 16,750 and 16,743, respectively, attended the second screen. in the second round, cin grade 3 or worse was less common in the intervention group than in the control group (88 of 19 579 in the intervention group vs 122 of 19,731 in the control group; relative risk 0\u00b773, 95% ci 0\u00b755-0\u00b796; p=0\u00b7023). cervical cancer was also less common in the intervention group than in the control group (four of 19 579 in the intervention group vs 14 of 19,731; 0\u00b729, 0\u00b710-0\u00b787; p=0\u00b7031). in the baseline round, detection of cin grade 3 or worse did not differ significantly between groups (171 of 19 999 vs 150 of 20,106; 1\u00b715, 0\u00b792-1\u00b743; p=0\u00b7239) but was significantly more common in women with normal cytology (34 of 19,286 vs 12 of 19,373; 2\u00b785, 1\u00b747-5\u00b749; p=0\u00b7001). furthermore, significantly more cases of cin grade 2 or worse were detected in the intervention group than in the control group (267 of 19 999 vs 215 of 20,106; 1\u00b725, 1\u00b705-1\u00b750; p=0\u00b7015). in the second screen, fewer hpv16-positive cin grade 3 or worse were detected in the intervention group than in the control group (17 of 9481 vs 35 of 9354; 0\u00b748, 0\u00b727-0\u00b785; p=0\u00b7012); detection of non-hpv16-positive cin grade 3 or worse did not differ between groups (25 of 9481 vs 25 of 9354; 0\u00b799, 0\u00b757-1\u00b772; p=1\u00b700). the cumulative detection of cin grade 3 or worse and cin grade 2 or worse did not differ significantly between study arms, neither for the whole study group (cin grade 3 or worse: 259 of 19 999 vs 272 of 20,106; 0\u00b796, 0\u00b781-1\u00b714, p=0\u00b7631; cin grade 2 or worse: 427 of 19 999 vs 399 of 20,106; 1\u00b708, 0\u00b794-1\u00b724; p=0\u00b7292), nor for subgroups of women invited for the first time (cin grade 3 or worse in women aged 29-33 years: 102 of 3139 vs 105 of 3128; 0\u00b797, 0\u00b774-1\u00b727; cin grade 2 or worse in women aged 29-33 years: 153 of 3139 vs 151 of 3128; 1\u00b701, 0\u00b781-1\u00b726; cin grade 3 or worse in women aged 34-56 years: 157 of 16,860 vs 167 of 16 978; 0\u00b795, 0\u00b776-1\u00b718; cin grade 2 or worse in women aged 34-56 years: 274 of 16,860 vs 248 of 16 978; 1\u00b711, 0\u00b794-1\u00b732). interpretation implementation of hpv dna testing in cervical screening leads to earlier detection of clinically relevant cin grade 2 or worse, which when adequately treated, improves protection against cin grade 3 or worse and cervical cancer. early detection of high-grade cervical legions caused by hpv16 was a major component of this benefit. our results lend support to the use of hpv dna testing for all women aged 29 years and older. funding zorg onderzoek nederland (netherlands organisation for health research and development)."

        "genome-wide dynamics of htz1, a histone h2a variant that poises repressed/basal promoters for activation through histone loss. histone variants help specialize chromatin regions; however, their impact on transcriptional regulation is largely unknown. here, we determined the genome-wide localization and dynamics of htz1, the yeast histone h2a variant. htz1 localizes to hundreds of repressed/basal pol ii promoters and prefers tata-less promoters. specific htz1 deposition requires the swr1 complex, which largely colocalizes with htz1. htz1 occupancy correlates with particular histone modifications, and htz1 deposition is partially reliant on gcn5 (a histone acetyltransferase) and bdf1, an swr1 complex member that binds acetylated histones. changes in growth conditions cause a striking redistribution of htz1 from activated to repressed/basal promoters. furthermore, htz1 promotes full gene activation but does not generally impact repression. importantly, htz1 releases from purified chromatin in vitro under conditions where h2a and h3 remain associated. we suggest that htz1-bearing nucleosomes are deposited at repressed/basal promoters but facilitate activation through their susceptibility to loss, thereby helping to expose promoter dna."

        "a view to a kill: the bacterial type vi secretion system.. the bacterial type vi secretion system (t6ss) is an organelle that is structurally and mechanistically analogous to an intracellular membrane-attached contractile phage tail. recent studies determined that a rapid conformational change in the structure of a sheath protein complex propels t6ss spike and tube components along with antibacterial and antieukaryotic effectors out of predatory t6ss(+) cells and into prey cells. the contracted organelle is then recycled in an atp-dependent process. t6ss is regulated at transcriptional and posttranslational levels, the latter involving detection of membrane perturbation in some species. in addition to directly targeting eukaryotic cells, the t6ss can also target other bacteria coinfecting a mammalian host, highlighting the importance of the t6ss not only for bacterial survival in environmental ecosystems, but also in the context of infection and disease. this review highlights these and other advances in our understanding of the structure, mechanical function, assembly, and regulation of the t6ss."
